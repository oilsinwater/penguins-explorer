# Risk Profile: Story 5.2

Date: 2025-10-07
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 5
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 82/100

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

None identified.

## High-Risk Items

### 1. TECH-001: Clipboard API compatibility issues

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Clipboard API requires HTTPS, may fail in local dev
**Impact**: Medium - Users won't be able to copy URLs in certain environments
**Mitigation**:

- Implement fallback using document.execCommand for HTTP environments
- Add user feedback when copy operations fail
- Test across different browsers and environments
  **Testing Focus**: Verify clipboard functionality in both HTTP and HTTPS contexts

### By Category

- Technical: 3 risks (1 high)
- Security: 1 risk (0 high)
- Operational: 1 risk (0 high)

### By Component

- Infrastructure: 1 risk

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description                      | Probability | Impact     | Score | Category    |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | ----------- |
| TECH-001 | Clipboard API HTTPS requirement  | Medium (2)  | Medium (3) | 6     | Technical   |
| TECH-002 | URL state restoration edge cases | Medium (2)  | Low (1)    | 2     | Technical   |
| TECH-003 | Browser navigation history bloat | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Technical   |
| SEC-001  | XSS in URL parameters            | Low (1)     | High (3)   | 3     | Security    |
| OPS-001  | Social preview metadata caching  | Low (1)     | Low (1)    | 1     | Operational |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- Clipboard functionality across different security contexts
- Fallback mechanism validation
- User feedback on copy operations

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- URL parameter sanitization
- State restoration with malformed URLs
- Browser back/forward navigation

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

- Social media preview rendering
- Performance impact of URL sync
- Accessibility compliance

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- Clipboard API fallback implementation
- URL parameter sanitization

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- None identified

### Accepted Risks

- Browser history management (acceptable with debouncing)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Clipboard API success/failure rates
- URL state restoration errors
- Social preview crawl requests

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Browser API changes detected
- New security vulnerabilities in URL handling
- Performance issues reported with URL sync
