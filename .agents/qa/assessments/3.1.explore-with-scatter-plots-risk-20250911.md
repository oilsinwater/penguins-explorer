## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description                                      | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                                                       |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TECH-001 | D3.js integration issues with React rendering    | Medium (2)  | High (3)   | 6     | High     | Use react-d3-library or hooks for safe integration; mock D3 in unit tests. Testing: Integration tests for re-renders. Residual: Low.      |
| PERF-001 | Slow rendering for full dataset (~344 points)    | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      | Implement data-binding and memoization as per story; lazy-load component. Testing: Performance benchmarks with Vitest. Residual: Minimal. |
| TECH-002 | Responsive design breaks on mobile/small screens | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   | Use MUI responsive props and D3 viewport events. Testing: Cypress on multiple viewports. Residual: Low.                                   |
| PERF-002 | Tooltip hover performance lag on dense plots     | Low (1)     | Low (1)    | 1     | Minimal  | Debounce hover events; use SVG optimizations. Testing: Manual interaction tests. Residual: Minimal.                                       |
| TECH-003 | Accessibility ARIA implementation errors         | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   | Follow WCAG 2.1; integrate axe-core. Testing: Accessibility audits. Residual: Low.                                                        |
| DATA-001 | Incorrect filtering when toggling legend species | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      | Validate getFilteredPenguins selector; unit test data flow. Testing: E2E with filtered data. Residual: Minimal.                           |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- Integration tests for D3-React (TECH-001): Verify no DOM conflicts on state changes.
- Test data: Full penguin dataset; edge cases (empty data, single species).

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- Cypress E2E: Responsive interactions (TECH-002, TECH-003) on mobile/desktop.
- Axe-core scans for ARIA (TECH-003).

### Priority 3: Low/Minimal Risk Tests

- Vitest unit: Performance mocks (PERF-001/002).
- Data validation tests (DATA-001).

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- TECH-001: Ensure stable D3 integration.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- All medium/low risks: Covered by existing test suite.

### Accepted Risks

- None; all mitigable.

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Frontend performance metrics (render times for scatter plots).
- Error rates on visualization routes.
- User interaction logs (hover/legend toggles).

## Risk Review Triggers

Review if: New D3 version adopted, dataset size increases, or accessibility feedback received.
