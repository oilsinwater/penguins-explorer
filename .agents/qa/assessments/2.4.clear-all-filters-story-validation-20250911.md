### Validation Report for Story 2.4: Clear All Filters

#### Template Compliance Issues

- **Missing sections**: None. All required sections present (Status, Story, Acceptance Criteria, Tasks/Subtasks, Dev Notes, Change Log, Dev Agent Record, QA Results).
- **Unfilled placeholders**: None (no `{{ }}` or `_TBD_`).
- **Structural formatting**: Compliant. Proper markdown with lists, tables, citations.

#### Critical Issues (Must Fix - Story Blocked)

- None. Story is complete, ACs traceable to PRD US2.4, tasks align with architecture.

#### Should-Fix Issues (Important Quality Improvements)

- **Testing Requirements**: Subtasks cover unit/integration/E2E, but specify axe-core for announcement in Task 4 explicitly (already implied; add for clarity).
- **Dev Notes > Performance**: Mentions memoization, but add note on reset re-render impact (minor, as dataset small).
- **File List**: Placeholder; will be filled post-impl, but confirm FiltersPanel.tsx exists (from 2.3 insights).

#### Nice-to-Have Improvements (Optional Enhancements)

- In Dev Notes > Testing, include sample test data (e.g., multi-filter state before reset).
- Add NFR note for a11y (e.g., aria-live politeness level) from architecture/accessibility.md.
- Cross-reference Epic 2 progress in Story section for context.

#### Anti-Hallucination Findings

- All claims sourced: UI from component-architecture.md#filter-components, state from state-management.md#filter-store, routing from routing.md, testing from testing-strategy.md#ui-testing.
- No inventions; patterns match previous (e.g., Context API reset from 2.3). References specific and accurate.

#### Final Assessment

- **GO**: Ready for implementation. Strong testability, low risk (simple UI reset), full AC coverage.
- **Implementation Readiness Score**: 9/10 (excellent context; minor testing specificity).
- **Confidence Level**: High (builds on proven filter patterns; no ambiguities). Proceed to dev.
