### 2. PERF-001: Mobile Performance Degradation

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Mobile devices may struggle with complex visualizations
**Impact**: High (3) - Poor performance on mobile devices leading to user abandonment
**Affected Components**: Charts, data rendering, responsive components
**Mitigation**:

- Optimize chart rendering for mobile devices
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical components
- Add performance monitoring for mobile views
  **Testing Focus**:
- Performance benchmarking on mobile devices
- Load time measurements across different devices

## Medium Priority Risks

### 3. UX-001: Touch Target Accessibility

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Elements may be too small for touch interaction
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Difficult interaction on mobile devices
**Affected Components**: Buttons, form controls, navigation elements
**Mitigation**:

- Audit all interactive elements for 44x44px minimum size
- Add appropriate spacing between touch targets
- Implement touch-friendly navigation patterns
  **Testing Focus**:
- Touch target size validation
- Interactive element spacing verification

### 4. FUNC-001: Feature Parity Between Desktop and Mobile

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Some features may not translate well to mobile
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Reduced functionality on mobile devices
**Affected Components**: All components with responsive variations
**Mitigation**:

- Maintain feature parity through progressive enhancement
- Implement graceful degradation for complex features
- Document any intentional differences in functionality
  **Testing Focus**:
- Feature availability verification across devices
- Functional equivalence testing

### 5. COMPAT-001: Browser Compatibility on Mobile Devices

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Low (1) - Older mobile browsers may have compatibility issues
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Limited access for users with older devices
**Affected Components**: All frontend components
**Mitigation**:

- Test on multiple mobile browsers
- Implement progressive enhancement for modern features
- Provide fallbacks for unsupported features
  **Testing Focus**:
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Feature detection and fallback validation

## Low Priority Risks

### 6. VISUAL-001: Chart Readability on Small Screens

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low (1) - Charts may be difficult to read on small screens
**Impact**: Low (1) - Minor inconvenience for users
**Affected Components**: ScatterPlot, Histogram, BoxPlot
**Mitigation**:

- Adjust chart dimensions for mobile
- Optimize labels and legends for small screens
- Implement zoom functionality for detailed exploration
  **Testing Focus**:
- Chart readability assessment
- Label and legend visibility verification

### 7. STORAGE-001: LocalStorage Limitations on Mobile

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low (1) - Mobile browsers may have storage limitations
**Impact**: Low (1) - Potential data loss for user preferences
**Affected Components**: FilterPanel (state persistence)
**Mitigation**:

- Implement quota checking for localStorage
- Provide fallback for storage failures
- Use efficient data serialization
  **Testing Focus**:
- Storage quota management verification
- Error handling for storage failures

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

The overall risk profile for Story 4.3 is low, with two high-priority risks that require specific attention. The implementation should focus on:

1. Comprehensive device testing to ensure layout consistency
2. Performance optimization for mobile devices
3. Touch accessibility validation
4. Feature parity verification between desktop and mobile views

Regular risk reassessment should occur during implementation as new issues may emerge.
