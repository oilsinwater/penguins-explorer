top_issues:
  - id: 'TEST-201'
    severity: high
    finding: 'Visualization panel spec fails because the combobox matcher still expects “X axis/Y axis,” breaking the unit regression suite.'
    suggested_action: 'Update `VisualizationPanel.test.tsx` to align with the new accessible labels (“X-axis”, “Y-axis”) and re-run Vitest.'
    refs:
      - src/components/visualizations/VisualizationPanel.test.tsx:62
  - id: 'TEST-202'
    severity: high
    finding: 'Cypress export flow uses stale selectors (`export-chart-button`) and filename expectations, so AC3/AC4 checks never execute.'
    suggested_action: 'Synchronize the Cypress spec with `ExportButton` (`data-testid="export-visualization-button"`) and new filename convention before rerunning the suite.'

  - id: 'DOC-202'
    severity: medium
    finding: 'Story artifact still lists Status “Ready for Done” and omits the required Testing section, leaving downstream agents without a reliable source of truth.'
    suggested_action: 'Realign the story document with the template (valid status + Testing section describing validations).'

    notes: 'Vitest spec fails on label mismatch, leaving regression suite broken.'
  maintainability:
    status: FAIL
    notes: 'Selector drift between code and Cypress tests plus template misalignment will continue to regress without correction.'

    - action: 'Fix failing Vitest spec and regenerate Cypress selectors/expectations, then rerun `npm run test` and Cypress suite.'
