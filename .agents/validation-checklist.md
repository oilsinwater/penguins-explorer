You're absolutely right. Let me perform a proper validation of the planning artifacts for consistency and completeness:

## Product Owner Validation Checklist for Palmer Penguins Explorer

### Document Cross-Reference Validation

#### 1. **Scope Consistency Check**

- [ ] ❌ **INCONSISTENCY FOUND**: Brief mentions "Simple statistical summary cards" as optional, but PRD and Technical Architecture don't include this feature
- [ ] ❌ **INCONSISTENCY FOUND**: Brief excludes "Dark mode toggle" but Front-End Spec includes dark mode considerations in Visual Design
- [ ] ✓ **CONSISTENT**: All docs agree on 3 core chart types (scatter, histogram, box plot)
- [ ] ✓ **CONSISTENT**: 344 penguins dataset size mentioned consistently
- [ ] ✓ **CONSISTENT**: 30-day timeline across all documents

#### 2. **Technical Stack Validation**

- [ ] ❌ **GAP IDENTIFIED**: PRD mentions "React Context or Zustand" but Technical Architecture firmly commits to Zustand
- [ ] ❌ **INCONSISTENCY**: Front-End Spec includes D3 for charts, but Brief and PRD suggest Strudel Chart components preferred
- [ ] ✓ **CONSISTENT**: Vite as build tool across all docs
- [ ] ✓ **CONSISTENT**: Client-side only, no backend

#### 3. **Feature Priority Alignment**

- [ ] ❌ **PRIORITY MISMATCH**: User Stories mark "Mobile Table View" as P1, but PRD implies it's P0 for responsive experience
- [ ] ❌ **MISSING IN PRD**: Keyboard shortcuts (/, ?, Esc) detailed in Front-End Spec but not in PRD requirements
- [ ] ✓ **ALIGNED**: Filter system consistently P0 across all docs
- [ ] ✓ **ALIGNED**: Welcome modal consistently P1

#### 4. **Performance Requirements Validation**

- [ ] ✓ **CONSISTENT**: < 2s initial load
- [ ] ✓ **CONSISTENT**: < 100ms filter updates
- [ ] ✓ **CONSISTENT**: < 300ms chart renders
- [ ] ❌ **GAP**: PRD specifies "< 500KB gzipped bundle" but Technical Architecture doesn't address bundle size strategy

#### 5. **URL Structure Validation**

- [ ] ❌ **INCONSISTENCY**: Technical Architecture shows `/visualize/scatter?x=bill_length&y=body_mass`, but Front-End Spec doesn't detail query param structure
- [ ] ✓ **CONSISTENT**: Basic routes (/table, /visualize/[chartType])

#### 6. **Component Naming Validation**

- [ ] ❌ **NAMING MISMATCH**: Technical Architecture uses "MobileTable.tsx" while Front-End Spec refers to card layout for mobile
- [ ] ✓ **CONSISTENT**: FilterPanel, DataTable, ScatterPlot naming

#### 7. **Accessibility Requirements**

- [ ] ✓ **CONSISTENT**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- [ ] ✓ **CONSISTENT**: Screen reader support
- [ ] ❌ **GAP**: PRD mentions "React Aria Live" but implementation details missing from Front-End Spec

#### 8. **Data Handling Validation**

- [ ] ✓ **CONSISTENT**: Missing values as "—" (em dash)
- [ ] ✓ **CONSISTENT**: Species/Island/Sex enums
- [ ] ❌ **UNCLEAR**: How missing sex values affect filtering not consistently specified

### Critical Gaps Identified

1. **State Management Decision**: Need to finalize Zustand vs React Context
2. **Charting Library**: Strudel Charts vs D3 needs resolution
3. **Bundle Size Strategy**: Missing implementation details for < 500KB requirement
4. **Mobile Table Implementation**: Card view vs horizontal scroll needs clarity
5. **URL Query Parameters**: Full specification needed for sharing functionality

### Recommendations Before Development

1. **Resolve Technical Decisions**:
   - Confirm Zustand for state management
   - Decide on D3 wrapped in React vs pure Strudel components
   - Document query parameter schema

2. **Clarify Mobile Strategy**:
   - Define exact mobile table behavior
   - Specify touch gesture requirements

3. **Complete Missing Specifications**:
   - Statistical summary cards (in/out of scope?)
   - Dark mode (remove from specs or implement?)
   - Bundle optimization strategy

4. **Priority Reconciliation**:
   - Align all P0/P1/P2 priorities across documents
   - Ensure mobile features have consistent priority

This validation reveals several inconsistencies that should be resolved before development begins to avoid confusion and rework.
