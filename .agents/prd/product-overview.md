# Product Overview

## Vision

Create a best-in-class demonstration of how modern, accessible data exploration tools can be built rapidly using Strudel Kit components.

### Mission Statement

Develop a Palmer Penguins data explorer that serves dual purposes: providing genuine educational value for biology students while demonstrating Strudel Kit's capabilities for building accessible scientific applications.

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- **Complete Data Explorer**: Functional data explorer deployed within 30 days
- **Accessibility Excellence**: Zero accessibility barriers (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)
- **Developer Experience**: Clean, documented codebase suitable for learning
- **Educational Value**: Genuine utility for biology students/educators

### Quality Standards

- **Performance**: < 2 second initial load, < 100ms filter updates
- **Usability**: Intuitive interface requiring no training
- **Reliability**: Error-free operation across target browsers
- **Maintainability**: Clear code structure and comprehensive documentation

### Impact Measures

- **Community Adoption**: GitHub stars and forks indicating developer interest
- **Educational Use**: Documented classroom or research usage
- **Technical Influence**: Reference implementations based on this project
- **Accessibility Recognition**: Positive feedback from accessibility community

## Target Users

### Primary Audience

1. **Biology Students** (Ages 18-25)
   - Exploring penguin ecology and measurements
   - Learning data visualization concepts
   - Requiring accessible tools for diverse abilities

2. **Educators** (Biology/Data Science)
   - Teaching statistical concepts with real data
   - Demonstrating data exploration techniques
   - Needing reliable, accessible classroom tools

### Secondary Audience

3. **Developers** (Evaluating Strudel Kit)
   - Assessing component library capabilities

   - Seeking modern React development examples

4. **Accessibility Advocates**
   - Verifying inclusive design practices
   - Evaluating WCAG compliance implementation
   - Testing screen reader compatibility

## Core Value Propositions

### For Students and Educators

- **Immediate Access**: No installation or account creation required
- **Real Scientific Data**: 344 actual penguin measurements from Palmer Station
- **Interactive Learning**: Multiple visualization types reveal different insights
- **Full Accessibility**: Works with screen readers, keyboard navigation, and assistive technologies

### For Developers

- **Modern Architecture**: React 18, TypeScript, and contemporary tooling
- **Strudel Integration**: Practical examples of component library usage
- **Accessibility Patterns**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance implementation
- **Performance Excellence**: Sub-2-second loads and responsive interactions

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

### Features Explicitly Excluded

- **Advanced Analytics**: Statistical analysis beyond basic summaries
- **Multi-Dataset Support**: Comparison with other datasets or species
- **User Persistence**: Authentication, saved views, or user accounts
- **Server Infrastructure**: Backend processing or database storage
- **Custom Theming**: User-customizable color schemes or layouts

### Technical Limitations

- **Offline Support**: Application requires internet connectivity
- **Data Updates**: Static dataset, no real-time data integration
- **Mobile Apps**: Web-only, no native mobile applications
- **Legacy Browser Support**: Modern browsers only (IE11+ not supported)

## Competitive Context

### Existing Solutions

- **R Shiny Apps**: Require R knowledge, often accessibility gaps
- **Tableau Public**: Complex interface, limited customization
- **Observable Notebooks**: Developer-focused, not beginner-friendly
- **Academic Tools**: Often outdated, poor mobile support

### Differentiation Strategy
