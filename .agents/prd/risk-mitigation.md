# Risk Mitigation

## Technical Risks

### High Priority Technical Risks

#### Risk: Strudel Kit Component Limitations

**Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: High

**Description**: Strudel Kit may not provide all required chart components or may have limitations that prevent implementation of required features.

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- **Fallback Plan**: Prepare D3.js direct implementation as backup
- **Early Validation**: Test all required Strudel components in first week
- **Component Assessment**: Evaluate Strudel Chart capabilities during sprint planning
- **Hybrid Approach**: Use Strudel for UI components, D3 for custom charts if needed

**Contingency Actions**:

- If Strudel Charts insufficient: Switch to D3.js with Strudel UI wrapper
- If major Strudel gaps found: Escalate to stakeholders for scope adjustment
- Maintain component library consistency even with mixed implementation

#### Risk: Performance Issues with Data Filtering

**Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: Medium

**Description**: Real-time filtering of 344 records with multiple chart updates may cause performance degradation below target thresholds.

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- **React Optimization**: Implement React.memo for expensive chart components
- **Debouncing**: Add 100ms debounce to filter updates to reduce computational load
- **Selective Updates**: Use React's scheduling features to prioritize visible content
- **Profiling**: Regular performance monitoring during development

**Contingency Actions**:

- If performance targets missed: Implement virtualization or pagination
- If memory leaks detected: Add cleanup in useEffect hooks
- If render blocking occurs: Move filtering to Web Workers

#### Risk: Browser Compatibility Issues

**Probability**: Low | **Impact**: Medium

**Description**: Modern JavaScript features or CSS properties may not work consistently across target browsers.

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core table view works without advanced features
- **Feature Detection**: Graceful fallbacks for unsupported features
- **Testing Strategy**: Continuous testing on target browser versions
- **Polyfill Avoidance**: Use only well-supported modern features

**Contingency Actions**:

- If critical features fail: Implement fallback UI patterns
- If widespread issues found: Adjust browser support matrix
- Provide clear messaging for unsupported browsers

### Medium Priority Technical Risks

#### Risk: Accessibility Compliance Gaps

**Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: High

**Description**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance may be harder to achieve than expected, especially for custom chart components.

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- **Accessibility-First Design**: Build with accessibility from start, not as afterthought
- **Expert Consultation**: Have accessibility expert review architecture early
- **Automated Testing**: Integrate axe-core into development workflow
- **User Testing**: Conduct screen reader testing with actual users

---

#### Risk: Data Visualization Complexity

**Probability**: Low | **Impact**: Medium

**Description**: Complex statistical calculations or chart rendering may be more challenging than anticipated.

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- **Prototype Early**: Build chart prototypes in first sprint
- **Library Research**: Identify statistical calculation libraries if needed
- **Simplified Approach**: Start with basic charts, enhance if time permits

## Scope Risks

### High Priority Scope Risks

#### Risk: Feature Creep

**Probability**: High | **Impact**: High

**Description**: Stakeholders or team members may request additional features that weren't in original scope, jeopardizing 30-day timeline.

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- **Strict PRD Adherence**: Reference this document for all feature decisions
- **Change Control Process**: Formal approval required for any scope changes
- **Regular Stakeholder Updates**: Weekly progress reviews to manage expectations
- **Priority Framework**: P0/P1/P2 classification enforced rigorously

**Contingency Actions**:

- If new features requested: Assess impact on timeline and quality
- If critical path affected: Negotiate trade-offs with stakeholders
- Document all scope changes and their rationale

---

#### Risk: Time Constraints

**Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: High

**Description**: 30-day timeline may be insufficient for full feature implementation with required quality standards.

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- **Agile Prioritization**: P0 features completed first, P1/P2 only if time permits
- **Daily Progress Tracking**: Monitor velocity and adjust scope accordingly
- **Buffer Time**: Reserve final 3 days for polish and bug fixes only
- **Quality Gates**: Don't sacrifice accessibility or performance for features

**Contingency Actions**:

- If behind schedule: Cut P2 features, then P1 features as needed
- If quality at risk: Extend timeline rather than compromise standards
- If major blocker found: Escalate immediately for stakeholder decision

---

### Medium Priority Scope Risks

#### Risk: Team Availability

**Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: Medium

**Description**: Key team members may become unavailable due to competing priorities or emergencies.

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- **Knowledge Sharing**: Document all architectural decisions and patterns
- **Cross-Training**: Multiple team members familiar with codebase
- **Clear Handoff Process**: Structured onboarding for new team members

---

#### Risk: Stakeholder Alignment

**Probability**: Low | **Impact**: Medium

**Description**: Misalignment between stakeholder expectations and delivered product.

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- **Regular Demos**: Weekly demonstrations of progress
- **Clear Success Criteria**: Quantifiable metrics in this PRD
- **Expectation Management**: Transparent communication about trade-offs

---

## Risk Monitoring

### Weekly Risk Assessment

- **Risk Register Review**: Evaluate all identified risks weekly
- **New Risk Identification**: Identify emerging risks during development
- **Mitigation Effectiveness**: Assess whether mitigation strategies are working
- **Contingency Readiness**: Ensure contingency plans remain viable

### Risk Escalation Triggers

- **Schedule Impact**: Any risk that threatens 30-day timeline
- **Quality Impact**: Risks to accessibility or performance requirements
- **Scope Impact**: Requests for major feature additions or removals
- **Technical Blockers**: Issues that cannot be resolved within team

### Success Indicators

- **No P0 Features Cut**: All critical path features implemented
- **Performance Targets Met**: All performance requirements achieved
- **Zero Accessibility Issues**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance maintained
- **Timeline Adherence**: Delivery within 30-day window
