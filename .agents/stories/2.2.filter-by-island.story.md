# Story 2.2: Filter by Island

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** to filter by island,  
**so that** I can focus on penguins from specific islands in the dataset.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Dropdown/select with options: All, Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen
2. "All" selected by default
3. Instant filtering on selection
4. Clear visual feedback of active filter

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Implement Island Filter Component** (AC: 1, 2, 4)
  - [x] Create `src/components/filters/IslandFilter.tsx`
  - [x] Implement MUI Select dropdown with island options
  - [x] Set "All" as default selection
  - [x] Add visual feedback for active filter (e.g., label with selected value)

- [x] **Task 2: Connect Filter to State Management** (AC: 2, 3)
  - [x] Update Context API in `src/context/actions.ts` for island filter state
  - [x] Integrate with existing filter state from SpeciesFilter
  - [x] Add URL persistence using TanStack Router for island parameter

- [x] **Task 3: Apply Filtering Logic** (AC: 3)
  - [x] Extend `src/utils/filtering.ts` to include island filtering
  - [x] Ensure real-time updates to table and visualizations
  - [x] Handle "All" option to show unfiltered data for island

- [x] **Task 4: Testing Implementation** (AC: All)
  - [x] Write Vitest unit tests for dropdown interactions in `tests/unit/components/filters/IslandFilter.test.tsx`
  - [x] Write Cypress integration tests for filter synchronization in `tests/integration/filters/IslandFilter.cy.tsx`
  - [x] Test URL state persistence and instant filtering in E2E tests
  - [x] Validate accessibility with axe-core for keyboard navigation and ARIA labels

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**Source: [docs/stories/2.1.filter-by-species.story.md#completion-notes]**

- Use Context API for global filter state management
- URL state persistence via TanStack Router works for multi-filter scenarios
- Filtering logic in `src/utils/filtering.ts` handles real-time updates efficiently
- Vitest and Cypress testing patterns established for filters

### UI Component Specifications

**Source: [docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#ui-framework]**

- Use MUI v5 Select component (@mui/material) for dropdown
- Emotion CSS-in-JS for styling
- MUI theme system for consistent design tokens
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with keyboard navigation and ARIA labels

### State Management Requirements

**Source: [docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#state-management]**

- Context API for global app state including filters
- Memoized selectors for performance in `src/context/selectors.ts`
- Integrate with existing filter state without conflicts

### Routing Integration

**Source: [docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#routing]**

- TanStack Router for URL state: Add `island` parameter (e.g., ?island=biscoe)
- Bidirectional sync: URL changes update state, state changes update URL

### File Structure Requirements

**Source: [docs/architecture/source-tree.md]**

```
src/
└── components/
    └── filters/
        └── IslandFilter.tsx  # MUI Select with island options and styling
```

Update `FilterPanel.tsx` to include IslandFilter alongside SpeciesFilter

### Testing Requirements

**Source: [docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]**

- **Unit Tests**: Vitest + React Testing Library in `tests/unit/components/filters/IslandFilter.test.tsx`
- **Integration Tests**: Cypress in `tests/integration/filters/IslandFilter.cy.tsx`
- **E2E Tests**: Cypress in `tests/e2e/user-flows/filtering.cy.ts`
- Coverage: Dropdown selection, URL sync, data updates, accessibility
- Test Data: Penguins distributed across islands (Biscoe: 168, Dream: 124, Torgersen: 52)

### Accessibility Requirements

**Source: [docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#accessibility]**

- WCAG 2.1 AA: Keyboard navigable dropdown
- ARIA labels for screen reader announcements on selection change
- Focus management for Select component

### Performance Considerations

**Source: [docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#performance]**

- Memoization for filter computations
- Debounced URL updates if needed for rapid selections
