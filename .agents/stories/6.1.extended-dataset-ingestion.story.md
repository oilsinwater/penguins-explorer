# Story 6.1: Extended Dataset Ingestion Integrity

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** data engineer,  
**I want** the extended Palmer Penguins dataset ingested accurately,  
**so that** the application can expose new categorical findings without losing data fidelity.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `Penguin` type includes `diet`, `life_stage`, and `health_metrics` fields with null-safe handling
2. Year range supports 2021–2025 and matches source data
3. Ingestion pipeline retains all extended fields in `public/data/penguins.json`
4. Category normalization maps variants (e.g., `Torgensen` → `Torgersen`) before filters consume data
5. Data assumptions and transformations documented for QA review

## Dependencies

- Completion status of previous epics verified; no upstream blockers identified for data ingestion work.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Story 5.2 established URL synchronization via `useURLSync`; extended filters must integrate with the same serialization patterns to keep shared links valid. [Source: .agents/stories/5.2.share-filtered-view.story.md]

### Data Models

- Data and filter stores in Zustand share a central `Penguin` model; any type updates must remain compatible with selectors that compute species/island distributions and numeric ranges. [Source: .agents/architecture/state-management.md#store-architecture]

### Data Flow

- Data loading sequence pulls from `public/data/penguins.json`, hydrates stores, and normalizes filter state via memoized selectors; transformations should occur before store hydration to avoid redundant recomputation. [Source: .agents/architecture/data-flow.md#initial-load-sequence]

### State Management

- The data store handles raw dataset storage, error handling, and computed maps; normalization utilities should feed through `loadData` to preserve caching and selector memoization guarantees. [Source: .agents/architecture/state-management.md#data-store-datastorets]

### File Locations

- Dataset and ingestion logic reside under `public/` and `src/hooks/` respectively; normalization helpers belong in `src/utils/` per project structure guidelines. [Source: .agents/architecture/source-tree.md#project-organization]

### Testing Requirements

- Follow the testing pyramid with Vitest coverage for transformers and helpers, integration checks for store updates, and ensure accessibility/performance budgets remain intact. [Source: .agents/architecture/testing-strategy.md#pyramid-distribution]

### Technical Constraints

- Performance budgets require filter interactions <100 ms and chart renders <300 ms; memoization and normalization must scale for ~3k records without breaching these targets. [Source: .agents/architecture/performance.md#performance-requirements]

### Project Structure Notes

- Maintain existing directory conventions and avoid introducing new top-level folders; reuse `utils/dataHelpers.ts` or create adjacent helpers to keep data processing centralized. [Source: .agents/architecture/source-tree.md#utility-organization]

## Project Structure Alignment

- No structural conflicts identified; planned updates align with established hooks, utils, and types locations documented in the architecture.

## Risks / Open Questions

- Normalization coverage tracked in `.agents/qa/assessments/6.1.extended-dataset-transformations-20251018.md`; extend mappings if upstream dataset introduces new aliases beyond `Torgensen` variants.

## Testing

### Testing Standards

- Follow Vitest-based unit coverage for transformers and helpers with files under `tests/unit/utils/` and `tests/unit/hooks/`. [Source: .agents/architecture/testing-strategy.md#file-locations]
- Add integration verification for store updates within `tests/integration/filters/` or equivalent suites to confirm normalized data flows. [Source: .agents/architecture/testing-strategy.md#pyramid-distribution]
- Ensure accessibility/performance automation remains green after ingestion changes by running the existing CI scripts (`npm run style:all`, Cypress smoke where applicable). [Source: .agents/architecture/testing-strategy.md#validation-requirements]

### Completion Notes

- Extended `Penguin` contracts with enumerated diets, life stages, health metrics, and year guardrails, keeping raw feed nullable-safe.
- Reworked ingestion transform with categorical normalizers, sex sanitization, and warning registry; filtered out invalid records.
- Added reusable normalization helpers plus QA summary accessors with targeted Vitest coverage and URL parsing alignment.
- Authored QA note `.agents/qa/assessments/6.1.extended-dataset-transformations-20251018.md` detailing assumptions and spot checks.
- Benchmarked ingestion: `transformPenguinData` averaged **0.913 ms** per run (~1,095 ops/sec) over 548 samples via `vitest bench`.
- Hardened accessibility integration suite with lightweight mocks for router-dependent components; eliminated prior act() warnings by switching tests to user-level tabbing.
- Updated year normalization to preserve future dataset values (no longer coerces to 2025) while still logging drift warnings for QA visibility.
- No additional ingestion tasks pending; next phase will focus on the downstream UI controls (Story 6.2).

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-18

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Requirements Traceability

- **AC1** – _Given_ the extended dataset contains diet, life*stage, and health_metrics fields, \_when* `transformPenguinData` runs, _then_ the resulting `Penguin` objects still expose those attributes with null-safe unions; validated by `src/hooks/__tests__/usePenguinData.test.tsx`.
- **AC2** – _Given_ years spanning 2021–2025, _when_ year normalization executes, _then_ valid years persist and out-of-range values trigger `console.warn`; verified via `normalizeYearValue` coverage in `src/utils/__tests__/dataHelpers.test.ts` and benchmark confirming ingestion performance below 1 ms.
- **AC3** – _Given_ the raw JSON feed, _when_ the ingestion hook hydrates data, _then_ no extended attributes are dropped; evidenced by the hook unit test verifying both array entries retain the new fields.
- **AC4** – _Given_ island aliases such as “Torgensen”, _when_ normalization runs, _then_ values are converted to canonical forms before filters use them; covered by `normalizeIslandValue` test cases.
- **AC5** – _Given_ QA needs documented assumptions, _when_ the ingestion completes, _then_ `.agents/qa/assessments/6.1.extended-dataset-transformations-20251018.md` documents mappings, spot-checks, and the new performance snapshot.

### Code Quality Assessment

The ingestion refactor centralizes categorical normalization and sanitizes numeric/sex fields before stores hydrate, which keeps downstream selectors stable. Enumerated literal unions in `src/types/penguin.ts` tighten compiler guarantees and reduce drift between filters and ingestion. The new helper warnings (`getUnexpectedCategorySummary`) offer lightweight observability for dataset drift, and unit coverage exercises key transformation paths. One adaptive risk remains: `normalizeYearValue` clamps any year outside 2021–2025 to `2025`, which would mislabel future records instead of surfacing the new value; that behaviour should be revisited before ingesting 2026+ data.

### Refactoring Performed

- None – analysis only; implementation left intact pending product decision on year-range handling.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ – Follows project TypeScript/MUI patterns, null-safety documented inline.
- Project Structure: ✓ – Changes confined to approved `hooks`, `utils`, `types`, and QA directories.
- Testing Strategy: ✓ – Added unit coverage around transformation and normalization, plus kept integration suite green.
- All ACs Met: ✓ – Functional behaviour and documentation satisfy stated acceptance criteria.

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Derive year bounds dynamically (or persist out-of-range values) instead of coercing everything above 2025 to 2025 so future datasets remain accurate.
- [ ] Expand unit coverage for `normalizeSpeciesValue`/`normalizeDietValue` to exercise the unexpected-category warning summary.
- [x] Recorded ingestion performance benchmark for QA.

### Security Review

No new security surface: transformations run on static dataset assets, no user input. Logging of unexpected categories is development-only and does not emit sensitive data.
