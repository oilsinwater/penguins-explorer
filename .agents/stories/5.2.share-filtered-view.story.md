# Story 5.2: Share Filtered View

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to share my filtered view,
**so that** I can collaborate with colleagues using specific data views.

_Part of Epic 5: Data Export & Sharing (.agents/prd/user-stories-acceptance-criteria.md)._

## Acceptance Criteria

1. URL structure: /visualize/[chartType]?[filters] (e.g., /visualize/scatter?x=bill_length&y=body_mass)
2. Copy URL button with confirmation
3. Loading shared URL restores exact state
4. Social sharing preview metadata

## Dependencies

- Story 5.1 “Save Visualizations” must be deployed and green (export button + route context work) to ensure the visualization panel, data providers, and export infrastructure remain stable. [Source: .agents/stories/5.1.save-visualizations.story.md]

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Story 5.1 introduced export functionality with canvas rendering and filename generation. Its implementation work and QA fixes must remain green before starting this story. [Source: .agents/stories/5.1.save-visualizations.story.md]
- Share functionality was intentionally deferred in Story 5.1; this story defines the new Share flow, so no Share-specific components or hooks currently exist. [Source: .agents/stories/5.1.save-visualizations.story.md]
- Existing query-parameter helpers live in `src/utils/queryParams.utils.ts` and can be extended instead of creating a brand-new serialization layer from scratch. [Source: .agents/architecture/routing.md]

### Data Models

- No specific data models required; this feature relies on existing Penguin and Filter types for state serialization. [Source: .agents/architecture/state-management.md]

### API Specifications

- No backend API required; URL sharing is entirely client-side using browser location APIs and the existing filter/chart state serialization methods. [Source: .agents/architecture/routing.md]

### Component Specifications

- Create a new `ShareButton` component in `src/components/export/ShareButton.tsx` rendered alongside `ExportButton`; it must copy the current visualization URL, expose success/failure feedback, and reuse existing button styling. [Source: .agents/architecture/component-architecture.md#sharebutton]
- Implement a new `useURLSync` hook in `src/hooks/useURLSync.ts` that keeps filter/chart state synchronized with the URL using 100 ms debounced updates. [Source: .agents/architecture/routing.md#url-synchronization-hook]
- Extend existing URL helpers (e.g., `src/utils/queryParams.utils.ts`) or add `src/utils/urlHelpers.ts` to serialize/validate filter and chart parameters. [Source: .agents/architecture/source-tree.md#utility-organization]
- URL parameter schema includes filters (species, island, sex) and chart configuration (x, y, field, bins, color); `useURLSync` should normalize missing or invalid values. [Source: .agents/architecture/routing.md#url-parameter-schema]

### File Locations

- New share UI components belong in `src/components/export/` (`ShareButton.tsx`, update any shared index files as needed). [Source: .agents/architecture/source-tree.md#project-organization]
- Hooks live in `src/hooks/`; create `useURLSync.ts` and corresponding tests under `src/hooks/__tests__/`. [Source: .agents/architecture/source-tree.md#hook-organization]
- URL parameter utilities should reside in `src/utils/urlHelpers.ts` (new file) or augment `src/utils/queryParams.utils.ts`. [Source: .agents/architecture/source-tree.md#utility-organization]
- Social preview metadata should be added to the `public/` directory as Open Graph assets (e.g., `public/social-preview.png`). [Source: .agents/architecture/source-tree.md#project-organization]

### Testing Requirements

- Follow the testing pyramid: Vitest/RTL for hook and component units, Cypress for end-to-end URL sharing flows. [Source: .agents/architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-strategy]
- Add ShareButton unit coverage in `src/components/export/__tests__/ShareButton.test.tsx` focusing on clipboard success/failure states. [Source: .agents/architecture/testing-strategy.md#file-locations]
- Create integration tests (e.g., `tests/integration/url-state-restoration.test.tsx`) validating URL hydration across filter/chart combinations using `useURLSync`. [Source: .agents/architecture/testing-strategy.md#file-locations]
- Extend Cypress E2E coverage (`cypress/e2e/user-flows/share-filtered-view.cy.ts`) for copy → open link → state restoration, including social metadata smoke checks. [Source: .agents/architecture/testing-strategy.md#file-locations]
- Run axe-core accessibility assertions to ensure the share button satisfies WCAG 2.1 AA expectations. [Source: .agents/architecture/testing-strategy.md#validation-requirements]

### Technical Constraints

- URL synchronization must use a 100 ms debounce to prevent excessive browser history entries during rapid filter changes. [Source: .agents/architecture/routing.md#url-synchronization-hook]
- URL parameters need validation/normalization to handle malformed query strings gracefully (extend existing helpers or add `validateAndNormalizeURL`). [Source: .agents/architecture/routing.md#deep-linking-support]
- Clipboard API requires HTTPS in production; provide fallback for local development using `document.execCommand('copy')` and surface user-facing error states. [Source: .agents/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Social preview metadata requires Open Graph meta tags in `index.html` with absolute URLs for preview images (e.g., `og:image`, `og:url`, `og:title`). [Source: .agents/architecture/source-tree.md]
- FilterStore and URL state must remain synchronized in both directions: user actions update the URL, and URL changes (browser back/forward, direct link) update filters. [Source: .agents/architecture/state-management.md#url-state-synchronization]

## Project Structure Notes

- Place the new ShareButton component in `src/components/export/` alongside ExportButton to keep export controls together. [Source: .agents/architecture/source-tree.md#project-organization]
- Centralize URL serialization/validation logic by extending `src/utils/queryParams.utils.ts` or adding `src/utils/urlHelpers.ts` if separation is clearer. [Source: .agents/architecture/source-tree.md#utility-organization]
- Social preview images are static assets in `public/` so external link crawlers can access them. [Source: .agents/architecture/source-tree.md#project-organization]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Build ShareButton with clipboard workflow** (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create `src/components/export/ShareButton.tsx` that wraps `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` and surfaces success/failure messaging. [Source: .agents/architecture/component-architecture.md#sharebutton]
  - [ ] Provide a fallback for browsers without Clipboard API support using `document.execCommand('copy')`. [Source: .agents/architecture/tech-stack.md]
  - [ ] Add unit tests in `src/components/export/__tests__/ShareButton.test.tsx` covering happy path, fallback, and error states. [Source: .agents/architecture/testing-strategy.md#file-locations]

- [ ] **Task 2: Implement URL synchronization hook** (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Implement `src/hooks/useURLSync.ts` to read/write filter and chart state with a 100 ms debounce. [Source: .agents/architecture/routing.md#url-synchronization-hook]
  - [ ] Normalize malformed parameters using helper utilities (invalid species, bins, etc.). [Source: .agents/architecture/state-management.md#state-validation]
  - [ ] Cover hydration edge cases with integration tests (e.g., `tests/integration/url-state-restoration.test.tsx`). [Source: .agents/architecture/testing-strategy.md#file-locations]

- [ ] **Task 3: Add social sharing metadata** (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Insert Open Graph meta tags in `index.html` (or via Helmet) with dynamic title, description, and image URL. [Source: .agents/architecture/source-tree.md#project-organization]
  - [ ] Create or reuse `public/social-preview.png` for the `og:image` property; ensure absolute URLs for crawlers. [Source: .agents/architecture/source-tree.md#project-organization]
  - [ ] Include Twitter Card meta tags (`twitter:card`, `twitter:title`, `twitter:image`). [Source: .agents/architecture/tech-stack.md]
  - [ ] Prepare a manual or automated smoke test confirming previews render in Slack/Twitter/LinkedIn.

- [ ] **Task 4: Expand regression and accessibility coverage** (AC: 1-4)
  - [ ] Write Cypress E2E coverage (`cypress/e2e/user-flows/share-filtered-view.cy.ts`) for copy → open shared link → confirm restored state. [Source: .agents/architecture/testing-strategy.md#file-locations]
  - [ ] Include axe-core assertions to validate ShareButton accessibility (keyboard support, aria-labels). [Source: .agents/architecture/testing-strategy.md#validation-requirements]
  - [ ] Add unit tests for URL helper functions (`serializeToURL`, `hydrateFromURL`, `validateAndNormalizeURL`) under `src/utils/__tests__/`. [Source: .agents/architecture/testing-strategy.md#file-locations]

## Testing

### Test File Locations

- Unit tests: `src/components/export/__tests__/ShareButton.test.tsx`, `src/utils/__tests__/urlHelpers.test.ts`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/url-state-restoration.test.tsx`
- E2E tests: `cypress/e2e/user-flows/share-filtered-view.cy.ts`

### Testing Frameworks and Patterns

- Vitest + React Testing Library for unit and integration tests
- Cypress for end-to-end user flow validation
- axe-core for automated accessibility compliance checks

### Specific Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Verify ShareButton click handler calls `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` with correct URL; mock Clipboard API and assert feedback UI updates.
- **Integration Tests**: Test URL state restoration across multiple filter/chart configurations (scatter, histogram, box plot with varying filters).
- **E2E Tests**: Full workflow from filter selection → chart configuration → share button click → URL copy → new browser tab → state verification.
- **Accessibility Tests**: Ensure ShareButton has proper ARIA attributes, keyboard activation works, and focus indicators meet WCAG standards.
- **Coverage Target**: 85% line coverage for ShareButton component and URL utility functions. [Source: .agents/architecture/testing-strategy.md#validation-requirements]
