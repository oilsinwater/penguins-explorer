# Story 3.1: Explore with Scatter Plots

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** to explore relationships between different measurements with scatter plots,  
**so that** I can visually identify trends, correlations, and outliers in the penguin data.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  X/Y axis dropdowns allow selection of any numeric column for the axes.
2.  Points on the scatter plot are colored by species, using the standard project palette.
3.  Hovering over a point displays a tooltip with the exact values and penguin details.
4.  A legend is present to identify the colors associated with each species.
5.  The legend is interactive, allowing the user to toggle the visibility of species on the plot.
6.  The chart is responsive and resizes appropriately for different screen sizes, with minimum and maximum dimensions.
7.  The chart includes alternative text that describes the visualization for screen reader users.

## Dev Notes

### UI Component Specifications

[Source: docs/architecture/component-architecture.md, docs/architecture/key-implementations.md]

- **`VisualizationPanel.tsx`**: This will be the main container for the chart and its controls.
- **`ChartTypeSelector.tsx`**: This existing component will handle switching to the scatter plot view. The route will be `/visualize/scatter`.
- **`AxisControls.tsx`**: A new component to be created. It should contain two dropdowns (MUI `Select`) for the X and Y axes. The dropdowns should be populated with the numeric fields from the dataset (e.g., `bill_length_mm`, `bill_depth_mm`, `flipper_length_mm`, `body_mass_g`).
- **`ScatterPlot.tsx`**: A new component to be created. This component will render the scatter plot using D3.js as shown in `key-implementations.md`. It will receive the filtered data and axis configuration as props.
- **`ChartLegend.tsx`**: A new component to be created. It will display the species and their corresponding colors. It should be interactive to toggle species visibility.

### State Management Requirements

[Source: docs/architecture/state-management.md]

- The `ScatterPlot.tsx` component should get its data from the `getFilteredPenguins` selector in `selectors.ts`.
- The state for the selected X and Y axes should be managed via URL parameters, as described in the routing section.
- The toggling of species visibility in the legend should update a local component state, which will then filter the data passed to the D3 rendering logic.

### Routing Integration

[Source: docs/architecture/routing.md]

- The scatter plot view will be accessible at `/visualize/scatter`.
- The selected X and Y axes will be stored in the URL as query parameters, e.g., `?x=bill_length_mm&y=body_mass_g`.
- The `VisualizationRoute.tsx` component will be responsible for parsing these URL parameters and passing them as props to the `ScatterPlot.tsx` and `AxisControls.tsx` components.

### Data Flow

[Source: docs/architecture/data-flow.md]

1.  User navigates to `/visualize/scatter`.
2.  `VisualizationRoute.tsx` mounts.
3.  `useURLSync` hook ensures filters are applied from the URL.
4.  `getFilteredPenguins` selector provides the filtered data.
5.  `VisualizationRoute.tsx` parses X/Y axis params from the URL (or uses defaults).
6.  The filtered data and axis configuration are passed to `ScatterPlot.tsx`.
7.  User changes an axis in `AxisControls.tsx`.
8.  `AxisControls.tsx` triggers a URL change via `setSearchParams`.
9.  `VisualizationRoute.tsx` re-renders with the new axis configuration from the URL.
10. The new configuration is passed to `ScatterPlot.tsx`, which re-renders the chart.

### File Structure Requirements

[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

- `src/components/visualizations/charts/ScatterPlot.tsx`
- `src/components/visualizations/AxisControls.tsx`
- `src/components/visualizations/ChartLegend.tsx`
- Update `src/components/visualizations/VisualizationPanel.tsx` to include the new components.
- Update `src/routes/VisualizationRoute.tsx` to handle the scatter plot case.

### Testing Requirements

[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- **Unit Tests (Vitest + RTL):**
  - `AxisControls.tsx`: Test that dropdowns render with the correct options and that changing a selection calls the callback function.
  - `ChartLegend.tsx`: Test that the legend renders correctly and that clicking on a species toggles its visibility.
  - `ScatterPlot.tsx`: Test that the component renders an SVG and that the D3 logic is called. Mock the D3 modules to avoid actual rendering in unit tests.
- **Integration Tests (Cypress Component Testing):**
  - Test the interaction between `AxisControls.tsx`, `ChartLegend.tsx`, and `ScatterPlot.tsx` within the `VisualizationPanel.tsx`.
- **E2E Tests (Cypress):**
  - A new E2E test to verify the full user flow: navigating to the scatter plot, changing axes, hovering over points, and toggling species in the legend.
- **Accessibility Tests (axe-core):**
  - Ensure the chart has proper ARIA labels and descriptions.
  - Ensure the controls are keyboard accessible.

### Performance Considerations

[Source: docs/architecture/performance.md]

- The `ScatterPlot.tsx` component should be lazy-loaded to reduce the initial bundle size.
- Memoization should be used for the data transformation logic before passing it to D3.
- Use D3's data-binding capabilities for efficient updates when the data changes.

## Tasks / Subtasks

## QA Results

### Review Date: Thu Sep 11 2025

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implemented components (AxisControls and ChartLegend) follow basic structure and MUI patterns. However, the overall project has TypeScript compilation errors, including in the new test files, indicating setup or import issues that need resolution. Tests for implemented components cover basic interactions but have assertion mismatches (e.g., using RTL matchers incorrectly in Vitest context).

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed as the story is incomplete. Recommend fixing TS errors in tests before proceeding.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✗ [TS errors in tests; assertions not properly imported/configured for Vitest/RTL]
- Project Structure: ✓ [Files in correct locations per architecture/source-tree.md]
- Testing Strategy: ✗ [Tests exist but fail compilation; no integration/E2E for scatter flow yet; coverage incomplete]
- All ACs Met: ✗ [Only AC 1,4,5 partially covered; AC 2,3,6,7 require missing ScatterPlot implementation]

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Resolve TypeScript errors in AxisControls.test.tsx and ChartLegend.test.tsx (import RTL matchers correctly)
- [ ] Complete Task 3: Implement ScatterPlot.tsx with D3, tooltips, responsiveness, and ARIA
- [ ] Complete Task 4: Integrate into VisualizationRoute.tsx with URL params and state management
- [ ] Add integration tests for full scatter plot flow
- [ ] Add E2E test for scatter user journey
- [ ] Run accessibility tests on the complete visualization
- [ ] Ensure lazy-loading and memoization for performance (AC 6)

### Security Review

No security concerns in implemented UI components.

### Performance Considerations

Implemented components are lightweight; no issues. Pending ScatterPlot needs D3 optimization.

### Files Modified During Review
