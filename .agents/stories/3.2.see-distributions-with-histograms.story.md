## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** to see distributions with histograms,  
**so that** I can understand the spread and frequency of penguin measurements by species.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Dropdown to select variable
2. Species shown as overlapping distributions
3. Adjustable bin size (5, 10, 20 bins)
4. Y-axis shows count
5. Clear color/pattern distinction for species

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Implement Histogram Component** (AC: 1, 2, 4, 5)
  - [ ] Create `src/components/visualizations/charts/Histogram.tsx` using D3 for bars and overlapping species [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#visualizations]
  - [ ] Add variable dropdown in `AxisControls.tsx` (extend for Histogram: select numeric field) [Source: docs/architecture/component-architecture.md#axis-controls]
  - [ ] Render overlapping histograms: bars for each species (stacked or semi-transparent), Y-axis as count [Source: docs/architecture/component-architecture.md#charts]
  - [ ] Use MUI theme colors with patterns (e.g., opacity 0.7 for overlap distinction) [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#ui-and-styling]

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**Source: [docs/stories/3.1.explore-with-scatter-plots.md#completion-notes]**

- D3 integration in ScatterPlot works with filtered data; reuse patterns for histogram scales/bars
- URL sync via TanStack Router handles axis params; extend for field/bins without conflicts
- MUI controls (Select/Slider) tested; add bin option to existing AxisControls
- Legend toggles filter data effectively; apply to histograms for species overlap
- Responsive charts with min dimensions (300x200px); use same for histograms
- Vitest/Cypress for viz: Mock D3, test with penguin subsets for distributions

### UI Component Specifications

**Source: [docs/architecture/component-architecture.md#visualization-components]**

- Histogram: D3 bars (rects) with x-scale linear for bins, y-scale linear for counts
- Overlap: Semi-transparent fills (opacity 0.6-0.8) + stroke for distinction
- Controls: Extend AxisControls with Select for variable, Slider for bins (min=5, max=20, step=5)
- Legend: Reuse from 3.1, filter bars on toggle
- Hover: D3 .on('mouseover') for tooltip with bin range/count per species
- Alt text: aria-label on svg for description

**Source: [docs/architecture/source-tree.md#visualizations]**

- Create `src/components/visualizations/charts/Histogram.tsx`
- Update `src/components/visualizations/AxisControls.tsx` for bins
- Update `src/components/visualizations/VisualizationPanel.tsx` to render Histogram for 'histogram'

### State Management Requirements

**Source: [docs/architecture/state-management.md#filter-store]**

- Use getFilteredPenguins selector; extend chartConfig: { type: 'histogram', field: string, bins: number }
- Actions: updateChartConfig(field, bins) to sync state/URL
- Derived: Compute histogram data (arrays of {bin: [min,max], counts: {species: number}}) with useMemo

### File Structure Requirements

**Source: [docs/architecture/source-tree.md]**

```
src/
└── components/
    └── visualizations/
        ├── charts/
        │   └── Histogram.tsx  # New: Core histogram component
        ├── AxisControls.tsx   # Update: Add field/bins controls
└── routes/
    └── VisualizationRoute.tsx  # Update: Render Histogram
```

Update `src/hooks/useChartConfig.ts` for histogram state.

### Testing Requirements

**Source: [docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#pyramid-distribution] + Previous Patterns**

- **Unit Tests**: Vitest in `tests/unit/components/visualizations/charts/Histogram.test.tsx`; mock D3, test bins/variable changes
- **Integration Tests**: Cypress in `tests/integration/visualizations/Histogram.cy.tsx`; test overlap/legend with data
- **E2E Tests**: Cypress in `cypress/e2e/user-flows/visualizations.cy.ts`; full: navigate histogram, adjust bins, hover
- Coverage: 85% lines; axe-core for a11y (descriptions, keyboard controls)
- Test Data: Penguins with varying measurements for bin distribution tests

### Accessibility Requirements

**Source: [docs/architecture/component-architecture.md#accessibility]**

- WCAG 2.1 AA: ARIA-describedby for svg; labeled controls (aria-label=&quot;Select variable&quot;)
- Hover: Focus equivalent for bars; ARIA-live for bin updates
- Legend: Reuse accessible toggles from 3.1

### Performance Considerations

**Source: [docs/architecture/data-flow.md#performance-optimizations-in-data-flow]**

- Memoize bin computations with useMemo on data/field/bins
- Debounce bin changes for URL sync
- Efficient D3 updates with .data() binding

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Requirements Traceability

- AC1: Covered by unit tests for dropdown, integration for updates on change.
- AC2: Verified via integration tests for overlaps/species filtering, E2E for visibility.
- AC3: Unit/integration for bin slider/compute, E2E verifies 5/10/20 options.
- AC4: Y-axis counts confirmed in unit/E2E; labels accurate.
- AC5: Color distinction tested in integration (opacity 0.7 + stroke); legend toggles work.

### NFR Validation

- **Security**: PASS - No new endpoints/data risks.
- **Performance**: PASS - Memoized bins under 50ms; D3 updates efficient.
- **Reliability**: PASS - Handles nulls/empty data; no crashes on filters.
- **Maintainability**: PASS - Reuses patterns (e.g., useChartConfig, Legend); strict TS.
- **Accessibility**: CONCERNS - ARIA labels present, but enhance hover/focus equivalents and full ARIA-live for dynamic updates.

### Risk Assessment

- Low probability/impact: Edge cases in binning with sparse data.
- Medium: Overlap readability on mobile (test responsive further).
- Overall: Low risk; feature stable.

### Test Coverage & Quality Metrics

- Unit: 85% lines (Histogram rendering, bin calc, hovers mocked).
- Integration: Overlap/legend interactions with real data.
- E2E: Full flows (select/toggle/adjust); a11y via axe-core (passes WCAG AA except hovers).
- Total: 28 scenarios; 90% AC traceability; no flakiness.

### Quality Gate

Gate: PASS (minor a11y concerns waived for next iter; retest post-tooltip enhancement) → docs/qa/gates/3.explore-data/3.2-see-distributions-with-histograms.yml

### Recommendations

1. Implement full MUI Tooltips for hovers with ARIA roles.
2. Add E2E for mobile overlap visibility.
3. Run full regression on viz routes post-merge.

### Recommended Status

[✓ Done - PASS with minor notes]

## Post-Development Remediation

### Date: 2025-09-16

### Remediation Completed by: Claude Code Assistant

### Issues Addressed

1. **MUI Tooltip Enhancement** (from QA Recommendation #1)
   - **Issue**: Histogram component had placeholder hover functionality with console logs instead of proper MUI Tooltips
   - **Solution**: Implemented full MUI Tooltip integration with:
     - Dynamic tooltip positioning based on bar rectangles
     - Species name, count, and range information display
     - Both mouse and keyboard accessibility support (mouseover/mouseout, focus/blur)
     - Proper ARIA roles and positioning with fixed placement
   - **Files Modified**: `src/components/visualizations/charts/Histogram.tsx`
   - **Impact**: Enhanced user experience and accessibility compliance

2. **Test Infrastructure Fixes**
   - **Issue**: Multiple test failures due to linting and TypeScript configuration issues
   - **Solution**:
     - Fixed ESLint configuration to include test files (\*.tsx) in tsconfig.json
     - Added null guards in DataTable valueFormatter to prevent runtime errors
     - Fixed FiltersPanel test router configuration and act() wrapping
     - Added config files to ESLint ignore patterns
   - **Files Modified**:
     - `.eslintrc.json` (ignore patterns)
     - `tsconfig.json` (include test files)
     - `src/components/table/DataTable.tsx` (null guards)
     - `tests/unit/components/FiltersPanel.test.tsx` (router config)
   - **Impact**: 92/92 tests now passing with proper linting compliance

### Quality Metrics Post-Remediation

- **Test Coverage**: 92 tests passing (100% success rate for included tests)
- **Code Quality**: ESLint passes with 0 errors
- **Accessibility**: Enhanced ARIA support with proper tooltip roles
- **User Experience**: Interactive tooltips provide detailed bin information on hover/focus

### Final Status

# **COMPLETE** - All QA recommendations addressed. Histogram component now provides full MUI Tooltip functionality with accessibility compliance and comprehensive test coverage.

Ready for Development

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to see distributions of penguin measurements with histograms,
**so that** I can understand the frequency distribution and range of values for different species.

_Part of Epic 3: Data Visualization from PRD (docs/prd/user-stories-acceptance-criteria.md)._

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Dropdown allows selection of any numeric variable (bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g).
2. Species are shown as overlapping distributions with clear visual distinction.
3. Adjustable bin size control with options for 5, 10, and 20 bins.
4. Y-axis shows count of observations.
5. Clear color/pattern distinction for different species using project palette.
6. Responsive sizing with appropriate dimensions for different screen sizes.
7. Alternative text describes the histogram for accessibility.

## Dev Notes

### UI Component Specifications

- **`VisualizationPanel.tsx`**: Update to handle histogram chart type.
- **`ChartTypeSelector.tsx`**: Add histogram option. Route: `/visualize/histogram`.
- **`HistogramControls.tsx`**: New component with variable dropdown and bin size selector.
- **`Histogram.tsx`**: New component rendering SVG histogram using D3.js with overlapping species distributions.

### State Management Requirements

- Use `getFilteredPenguins` selector from `selectors.ts`.
- Variable selection managed via URL params.
- Bin size: local state in `HistogramControls.tsx`, passed to D3.

### Routing Integration

- Route: `/visualize/histogram`.
- URL params: `?variable=bill_length_mm&bins=10`.
- `VisualizationRoute.tsx` parses params, passes to components.

### Data Flow

1. Navigate to `/visualize/histogram`.
2. `VisualizationRoute.tsx` mounts, applies URL filters.
3. `getFilteredPenguins` provides data.
4. Parse variable/bins from URL (defaults if none).
5. Pass data/config to `Histogram.tsx`.
6. Variable change in `HistogramControls.tsx` → URL update → re-render.

### File Structure Requirements

- `src/components/visualizations/charts/Histogram.tsx`
- `src/components/visualizations/HistogramControls.tsx`
- Update `src/components/visualizations/VisualizationPanel.tsx`.
- Update `src/routes/VisualizationRoute.tsx`.

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit (Vitest + RTL)**: Variable dropdown, bin size selector, D3 histogram rendering.
- **Integration (Cypress Component)**: Interactions in `VisualizationPanel`.
- **E2E (Cypress)**: Full flow (navigate, change variable, adjust bins).
- **Accessibility (axe-core)**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation.

### Performance Considerations

- Lazy-load `Histogram.tsx`.
- Memoize histogram calculations for D3.
- Use D3 data-binding for efficient updates when bins change.
