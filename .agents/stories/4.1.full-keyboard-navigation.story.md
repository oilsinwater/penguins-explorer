# Story 4.1: Full Keyboard Navigation

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** keyboard user,
**I want** full keyboard navigation throughout the application,
**so that** I can efficiently navigate and interact with all features without using a mouse.

_Part of Epic 4: Accessibility & Usability from PRD (.agents/prd/user-stories-acceptance-criteria.md)._

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Tab order follows logical flow throughout the application
2. All interactive elements are reachable and operable with keyboard
3. Visual focus indicators meet WCAG standards for visibility
4. Skip to main content link is available and functional
5. Keyboard shortcuts implemented: / focuses search, ? opens help, Esc closes modals
6. Escape key consistently closes modals and dropdowns

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Previous stories have established accessibility patterns in the ScatterPlot component with keyboard navigation for data points using arrow keys and focus management. The architecture already includes dedicated a11y components and ARIA patterns.

### Component Structure Requirements

[Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#accessibility-components]

- **`SkipLinks.tsx`**: Hidden links that appear on focus for keyboard navigation shortcuts (skip to main content, filters, and data)
- **`FocusTrap.tsx`**: Modal focus management component for trapping focus within modal dialogs
- **Existing components need enhancement**: MainLayout, FilterPanel, DataTable, ChartTypeSelector, modals

### File Locations

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#accessibility-components]

- `src/components/a11y/SkipLinks.tsx` - Skip link implementation
- `src/components/a11y/FocusTrap.tsx` - Focus trap for modals
- `src/hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts.ts` - Global keyboard shortcut handling
- Update existing layout and interaction components for proper tab order

### UI Component Specifications

[Source: architecture/component-architecture.md, architecture/key-implementations.md]

- **Focus indicators**: Use MUI theme's focus styles with WCAG AA compliant contrast ratios
- **Tab order**: Logical flow through MainLayout → Skip links → FilterPanel → TabNavigation → Main content
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Global event handlers for / (search focus), ? (help modal), Esc (close)
- **Interactive elements**: All buttons, links, form controls, chart elements must be focusable

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- **Unit Tests (Vitest + RTL)**: Keyboard event handling, focus management, tab order
- **Integration Tests (Cypress Component)**: Component keyboard interactions, modal focus traps
- **E2E Tests (Cypress)**: Full keyboard navigation flows, skip link functionality
- **Accessibility Tests (axe-core)**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, zero critical violations for keyboard navigation

### Technical Constraints

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, architecture/coding-standards.md]

- Use MUI's built-in focus management utilities
- Follow ARIA patterns consistently across all components
- Maintain TypeScript strict mode compliance for all accessibility code
- Use established coding standards with proper component structure

### Test Data Requirements

[Addresses QA Finding TEST-001]

- **Keyboard Navigation Test Data**: Use existing penguins.json dataset (344 records) with specific filtering scenarios:
  - Empty filter results for testing "no data" keyboard navigation
  - Full dataset for testing pagination keyboard navigation
  - Species filter combinations (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo) for multi-select keyboard testing
- **Screen Reader Test Scenarios**:
  - Chart data with mixed data types for ARIA label generation
  - Filter state announcements with various active filter combinations
  - Modal content with structured heading hierarchy

### Keyboard Shortcut Conflict Prevention

[Addresses QA Finding ARCH-001]

- **Browser Conflict Strategy**:
  - `/` key: Only activate when no form inputs are focused to avoid conflicts with search
  - `?` key: Use Shift+/ combination, check for existing help shortcuts in browser
  - `Esc` key: Standard behavior, safe to implement for modal/dropdown closing
- **Implementation**: Add event.preventDefault() and event.stopPropagation() for captured shortcuts
- **Documentation**: Include keyboard shortcut help in HelpModal with conflict notes

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-16

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Comprehensive QA Review with Active Refactoring

**Scope**: Post-implementation comprehensive review with test suite fixes and quality improvements

**Code Quality Assessment**

Implementation demonstrates excellent adherence to accessibility principles with comprehensive WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. The architecture follows MUI best practices and maintains consistency with existing codebase patterns. Components are well-structured with proper separation of concerns.

**Refactoring Performed**

- **File**: `src/components/visualizations/charts/ScatterPlot.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Fixed D3 mocking setup with proper axis function calls
  - **Why**: Tests were failing due to incomplete mock selection objects
  - **How**: Created comprehensive mock selection object with all required D3 methods

- **File**: `tests/integration/accessibility/keyboard-navigation.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Fixed router configuration with proper route tree setup
  - **Why**: Integration tests failing due to empty routes array
  - **How**: Implemented proper router with root and index routes

- **File**: `tests/integration/accessibility/axe-compliance.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Fixed router configuration matching keyboard navigation tests
  - **Why**: Consistency and preventing router-related test failures
  - **How**: Applied same router fix as keyboard navigation tests

- **File**: `tests/unit/components/FiltersPanel.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Added missing helpModalOpen field to mock state
  - **Why**: Context provider interface mismatch causing test failures
  - **How**: Updated mock state to include all required AppState fields

**Compliance Check**

- Coding Standards: ✅ Follows project TypeScript and React patterns
- Project Structure: ✅ Proper accessibility component organization
- Testing Strategy: ✅ Comprehensive unit, integration, and E2E coverage
- All ACs Met: ✅ All 6 acceptance criteria fully implemented

**Improvements Checklist**

- [x] Fixed ScatterPlot D3 mocking for reliable test execution
- [x] Fixed router configuration in integration tests
- [x] Fixed FiltersPanel test context mocking
- [x] Updated quality gate with current findings
- [ ] Consider adding performance benchmarks for keyboard navigation
- [ ] Add more comprehensive E2E test coverage for edge cases
- [ ] Document keyboard navigation patterns for future components

**Security Review**

No security concerns identified. Keyboard navigation implementation follows secure patterns:

- Proper event handling with preventDefault/stopPropagation
- ARIA patterns prevent information disclosure
- Focus management respects browser security boundaries

**Performance Considerations**

Keyboard navigation adds minimal performance overhead:

- Event listeners are properly cleaned up in useEffect returns
- Focus trap uses efficient DOM queries
- Skip links are hidden/shown via CSS transforms

**Files Modified During Review**

- src/components/visualizations/charts/ScatterPlot.test.tsx (test mocking fixes)
- tests/integration/accessibility/keyboard-navigation.test.tsx (router configuration)
- tests/integration/accessibility/axe-compliance.test.tsx (router configuration)
- tests/unit/components/FiltersPanel.test.tsx (context mocking)
- .agents/qa/gates/4.1-full-keyboard-navigation.yml (quality gate update)

**Requirements Traceability**

All 6 acceptance criteria have complete test coverage:

- AC1 (Tab order): ✅ keyboard-navigation.test.tsx + axe compliance
- AC2 (Interactive elements): ✅ keyboard navigation + scatter plot tests
- AC3 (Focus indicators): ✅ visual focus + axe compliance validation
- AC4 (Skip links): ✅ SkipLinks.test.tsx + integration tests
- AC5 (Keyboard shortcuts): ✅ useKeyboardShortcuts.test.ts + integration
- AC6 (Escape handling): ✅ FocusTrap.test.tsx + modal integration

**Gate Status**

Gate: CONCERNS → .agents/qa/gates/4.1-full-keyboard-navigation.yml

**Quality Score**: 80/100 (reduced from implementation quality due to test suite issues)

**Recommended Status**

[✗ Changes Required - Test fixes need to be committed and test suite must pass before Done]

The implementation itself is excellent, but the test suite stability issues need resolution before this can be marked as complete.
