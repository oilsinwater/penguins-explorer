decision: CONCERNS
rationale: |
  Story well-defined with clear ACs and tasks, but Task 3 depends on Epic 3 visualizations (not yet implemented). 
  Recommend proceeding with Tasks 1-2 first, then re-gate after Epic 3. 
  Testing coverage planned but needs validation post-implementation.
qa_results:
  - traceability: PASS
  - risk_assessment: MEDIUM
  - nfr_validation: PASS
  - test_design: PENDING
