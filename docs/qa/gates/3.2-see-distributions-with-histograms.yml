gate:
  status: FAIL
  score: 0
  reviewed_by: Quinn
  review_date: 2025-09-13 (Re-review)
  rationale: |
    No development progress on re-review. Test design established but implementation absent.
    Cannot validate ACs, NFRs, or testability. Gate blocks until code completion and validation.
  risks:
    - implementation_missing: High impact, high probability - no code exists
    - d3_integration: Medium impact, high probability - overlapping visuals unproven
    - performance_binning: Medium impact, medium probability - efficiency untested
  recommendations:
    - Start development with controls (Task 1), integrate tests early.
    - Prototype D3 overlaps for visual risk mitigation.
    - Execute test design post-Task 2.
    - Re-gate after full implementation.
  quality_attributes:
    performance: Not assessed (recommend memoization for bins)
    accessibility: Defined but untested (dynamic alt text needed)
    security: Low (client-side viz)
    reliability: Not assessed (missing values handling pending)
  next_steps:
    - [ ] Implement components and updates
    - [ ] Run test suite per design
    - [ ] Re-run comprehensive review
