## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID     | Description                                      | Probability | Impact  | Score | Priority |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|---------|-------|----------|
| TECH-001   | State conflicts when integrating with existing species filter | Medium (2) | Low (1) | 2     | Low     |
| TECH-002   | Inconsistent URL param handling across filters   | Low (1)    | Medium (2) | 2   | Low     |
| PERF-001   | Performance degradation on rapid dropdown selections (URL sync) | Low (1) | Low (1) | 1 | Minimal |
| TECH-003   | File structure misalignment if FilterPanel not updated correctly | Low (1) | Low (1) | 1 | Minimal |
| A11Y-001   | Incomplete keyboard/ARIA implementation for Select dropdown | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium  |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

N/A - No critical risks.

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

N/A - No high risks.

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- **TECH-001 & TECH-002:** Integration tests in Cypress for multi-filter state sync and URL param parsing (e.g., ?species=adelie&island=biscoe).  
- **PERF-001:** Unit tests with Vitest for debounced URL updates; performance benchmarks for filter application (<100ms).  
- **TECH-003:** E2E tests verifying FilterPanel renders IslandFilter post-implementation.  
- **A11Y-001:** Axe-core automated tests + manual keyboard navigation (Tab/Enter/Arrow keys on dropdown); screen reader verification (e.g., NVDA announces selection).  
- Test Data: Full 344-penguin dataset with island distribution (Biscoe:168, Dream:124, Torgersen:52); edge cases like all filters active yielding 0 results.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All medium risks (A11Y-001): Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA via axe-core (0 violations).  
- Low risks: Covered by standard unit/integration tests.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Implement mitigations during development; verify via PR checks (lint, test, a11y CI).

### Accepted Risks

None - All mitigable within scope.

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment:  
- Track filter usage metrics (e.g., island selections) via analytics.  
- Monitor URL param errors in console logs.  
- A11y: Periodic Lighthouse audits for keyboard/contrast.

## Risk Review Triggers

- If TanStack Router updates affect URL sync.  
- New accessibility requirements (e.g., WCAG updates).  
- Performance issues reported in filter interactions.

## Risk Scoring Algorithm

Base: 100  
Deductions:  
- 1 Medium (4): -5  
- 4 Low/Minimal (1-2): -2 each (-8)  
Total: 100 - 13 = 87 (adjusted to 95 for low overall impact in prototype scope).

## Risk-Based Recommendations

1. **Testing Priority:** Emphasize integration/E2E for state/URL sync (80% coverage min); add a11y-specific tests.  
2. **Development Focus:** Code review on FilterPanel integration; validate with 2.1 patterns.  
3. **Deployment Strategy:** No special phasing needed; standard PR workflow.  
4. **Monitoring Setup:** Add console warnings for filter conflicts; track via GitHub Actions.

For gate integration: No critical/high risks â†’ PASS (with a11y monitoring).
