Date: 2025-09-10
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 4
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 0
- Medium Risks: 1
- Low Risks: 3
- Risk Score: 92/100 (Low Risk Profile)

## Medium Risk Requiring Attention

### DATA-001: Missing Sex Value Handling

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Edge case handling always has implementation risk
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Users might miss data analysis opportunities if null values excluded
**Mitigation**:

- Implement explicit "All" option that includes null/undefined sex values
- Add comprehensive test scenarios for missing data edge cases
- Validate filtering logic handles null/undefined correctly
  **Testing Focus**: Unit tests for null value handling, integration tests for "All" option behavior

## Low Risk Items

### TECH-001: State Management Integration

**Score: 2 (Low)** - Context API integration complexity mitigated by established patterns from Stories 2.1 & 2.2

### BUS-001: User Experience Consistency

**Score: 1 (Minimal)** - Radio group UX differs slightly from checkbox/dropdown but follows standard MUI patterns

### PERF-001: Combined Filtering Performance

**Score: 1 (Minimal)** - Third filter impact negligible due to memoized filtering and small dataset (344 records)

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Technical: 1 risk (0 critical, 1 low)
- Data: 1 risk (0 critical, 1 medium)
- Business: 1 risk (0 critical, 1 low)
- Performance: 1 risk (0 critical, 1 low)
- Security: 0 risks
- Operational: 0 risks

### By Component

- Frontend Component: 2 risks (UI consistency, state integration)
- Data Layer: 1 risk (missing value handling)
- Performance: 1 risk (filtering efficiency)

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Category    | Description                       | Probability | Impact | Score | Mitigation Status |
| -------- | ----------- | --------------------------------- | ----------- | ------ | ----- | ----------------- |
| DATA-001 | Data        | Missing sex value handling        | Medium (2)  | Med(2) | 4     | Test coverage     |
| TECH-001 | Technical   | State management integration      | Low (1)     | Med(2) | 2     | Proven patterns   |
| BUS-001  | Business    | UX consistency with other filters | Low (1)     | Low(1) | 1     | MUI standards     |
| PERF-001 | Performance | Combined filtering performance    | Low (1)     | Low(1) | 1     | Memoized logic    |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Medium Risk Tests

- **DATA-001 Coverage**: Test scenarios for null/undefined sex values
- **All Option Behavior**: Verify "All" includes penguins with missing sex data
- **Edge Case Handling**: Test malformed or unexpected sex values

### Priority 2: Integration Risk Tests

- **State Management**: Verify Context API integration doesn't affect other filters
- **Combined Filtering**: Test all three filters (species, island, sex) working together
- **URL Persistence**: Verify sex parameter syncs correctly with TanStack Router

### Priority 3: Standard Functional Tests

- **Radio Group Behavior**: Standard MUI RadioGroup functionality
- **Visual Consistency**: UI matches other filter components
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Ready for Implementation

- All risks are low or medium with clear mitigation strategies
- No critical or high risks requiring architectural changes
- Test coverage addresses primary risk (missing value handling)

### Monitoring Requirements

Post-implementation monitoring for:

- Data completeness: Track how many penguins have missing sex values
- User behavior: Monitor which filter options are most commonly used
- Performance: Watch for any slowdown as filtering logic becomes more complex

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Dataset size increases significantly (>1000 records)
- Additional filter types are added beyond species/island/sex
- User reports data inconsistencies with sex filtering
- Performance issues emerge with combined filtering
