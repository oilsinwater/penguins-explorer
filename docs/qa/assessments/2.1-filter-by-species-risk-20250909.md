**Date:** 2025-09-09  
**Reviewer:** Quinn (Test Architect)  
**Story:** `docs/stories/2.1.filter-by-species.story.md`

## Executive Summary

- **Total Risks Identified:** 8
- **Critical Risks:** 0 
- **High Risks:** 1
- **Medium Risks:** 3
- **Low Risks:** 4
- **Risk Score:** 73/100 (Good - Moderate risk profile)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

*None identified - highest risk score is 6*

## High Risk Analysis

### PERF-001: URL State Management Performance
**Score:** 6 (Critical)  
**Probability:** Medium - TanStack Router URL sync could cause performance issues with rapid filter changes  
**Impact:** High - Poor UX with laggy interactions, potential browser history pollution  
**Mitigation:**

- Implement debounced URL updates (300ms delay)
- Use shallow URL history updates to prevent browser back/forward pollution
- Add performance monitoring for filter interaction response times  
- Test with rapid checkbox clicking scenarios

**Testing Focus:** Performance tests with rapid filter changes (>10 clicks/second)

| BUS-001   | Species Names Mismatch        | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2   | Low      | Accepted          |
| OPS-001   | Missing Test Coverage         | Medium (2)  | Low (1)  | 3     | Low      | Monitor           |
| TECH-002  | MUI Checkbox Theme Override   | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2   | Low      | Accepted          |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- Performance tests with rapid filter changes (>10 clicks/second)
- Browser history navigation tests
- URL sync accuracy validation
- Debouncing validation tests

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- Screen reader announcement validation with NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver
- State synchronization tests across DataTable and future visualizations  
- Edge case URL parameter handling tests
- Context API integration testing

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- Standard functional checkbox interaction tests
- MUI theme consistency validation
- Species name accuracy verification
- Keyboard navigation workflow tests

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- **PERF-001:** URL performance optimization with debouncing implementation

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- **A11Y-001:** Screen reader testing with manual validation fallback
- **TECH-001:** State sync monitoring with clear debugging capabilities
- **DATA-001:** Robust error boundaries and parameter validation

### Accepted Risks
- **SEC-001:** Client-side filter bypass (no security implications for read-only data)
- **BUS-001:** Species name validation (low probability with established dataset)
- **TECH-002:** MUI theme consistency (established patterns from Story 1.1)
- **OPS-001:** Test coverage gaps (comprehensive plan mitigates risk)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Performance metrics:** Filter interaction response times (<100ms target)
- **Security alerts:** JavaScript errors related to Context API state updates  
- **Error rates:** URL parameter parsing errors in application logs
- **Business KPIs:** User engagement with filtering functionality

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- TanStack Router implementation patterns change
- Additional visualization components added (affects state synchronization)
- Screen reader technology updates affect accessibility testing
- Performance requirements change based on user feedback

## Gate Integration

**Deterministic Gate Mapping:**
- Highest risk score: 6 â†’ Gate = **CONCERNS**
- Must address URL performance optimization before production deployment
- Can proceed with implementation given comprehensive mitigation strategies
