## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- **Screen Reader Conflict Testing**: Simulate multiple simultaneous updates (filter + loading + chart changes)
- **Description Accuracy Validation**: Cross-reference generated descriptions with actual chart data
- **Announcement Queue Testing**: Verify proper debouncing and prioritization
- **Screen Reader User Testing**: Real user validation with NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- **Performance Impact Testing**: Measure performance with rapid filter changes and announcements
- **WCAG Compliance Audit**: Comprehensive axe-core and manual testing
- **Loading State Testing**: Verify proper announcement timing during data fetching
- **Async State Management**: Test race conditions and state synchronization

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Test with multiple screen reader/browser combinations
- **Form Control Audit**: Systematic review of all interactive elements
- **Content Structure Validation**: Verify announcement templates and patterns

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- High risks (TECH-001, TECH-002) must be mitigated with proper testing
- Screen reader announcement conflicts eliminated
- Description accuracy validated through testing

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks acceptable with monitoring and compensating controls
