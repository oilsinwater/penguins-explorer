# Risk Assessment: Story 2.4 - Clear All Filters

## Risk Summary

This low-complexity UI story involves adding a reset button to the existing filter panel. Overall risk is low due to established patterns from previous filter stories (2.1-2.3). Primary concerns are state synchronization and accessibility announcements, but mitigations leverage existing Context API and MUI components. Total risks: 3 (all low). No critical/high risks.

**Overall Risk Score:** 85/100 (Low - Routine UI enhancement with proven tech)

## Risk Matrix

| ID     | Category     | Description                                                                 | Probability | Impact | Score | Mitigation Strategy |
|--------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------|-------|---------------------|
| UI-001 | Usability   | Button visibility/count not updating correctly on filter changes            | Low (20%)  | Low   | 2     | Use Context API selector for active count; unit test visibility |
| STATE-001 | State Mgmt | Incomplete state reset (e.g., misses URL params or partial dispatch)        | Medium (40%) | Medium | 4     | Single CLEAR_ALL_FILTERS action dispatching all resets; integration test full reset |
| A11Y-001 | Accessibility | Screen reader announcement not triggered or unclear (aria-live issues)     | Low (30%)  | Medium | 3     | Use aria-live="polite" with MUI Alert; axe-core validation + manual NVDA test |
| PERF-001 | Performance | Reset re-render causes brief lag on large datasets (unlikely for this data) | Low (10%)  | Low   | 1     | Memoize filter computations (existing from filtering.ts); monitor in E2E |

**Scoring:** Probability (Low=1-3, Med=4-7, High=8-10) Ã— Impact (Low=1, Med=2, High=3). Aggregated: Sum scores / max possible (low risk <20).

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Must Fix)
- None. All mitigations cover potential issues via tests.

### Monitor
- Verify reset in combined filters E2E (with species/island/sex active).
- Test a11y on multiple screen readers if time allows.

### Future
- Extract common reset logic if more filters added (e.g., Epic 3).

Risks manageable with standard testing; no blockers. Proceed to implementation.
