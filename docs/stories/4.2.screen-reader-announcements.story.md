# Story 4.2: Screen Reader Announcements

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** screen reader user,
**I want** meaningful announcements for dynamic updates,
**so that** I can follow changes in the explorer without relying on visuals.

_Part of Epic 4: Accessibility & Usability (docs/prd/user-stories-acceptance-criteria.md)._

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Live regions announce filter changes with concise summaries.
2. Chart descriptions update to reflect the currently rendered data.
3. All form controls expose accurate labels and programmatic relationships.
4. Landmark regions (header, navigation, main content) are clearly defined for assistive tech.
5. Loading states trigger announcements so users know when data is fetching or ready.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- `MainLayout` already centralizes skip links, focus management, and the global live region—extend its patterns instead of introducing parallel wrappers. [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#mainlayout]
- The root layout renders `LiveRegion` alongside header and content areas; enhancements must keep the single announcement surface to avoid duplicate speech. [Source: architecture/routing.md#mainlayout---root-layout-component]

### Data Models

- No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### API Specifications

- No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### Component Specifications

- `LiveRegion` is the designated ARIA `polite` announcer for filter changes; reuse it for chart and loading updates. [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#liveregion]
- Visualization containers are responsible for responsive sizing and accessible descriptions; extend `ChartContainer`/`VisualizationPanel` to surface chart summaries. [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#chartcontainer]
- Tab navigation and visualization routes already expose ARIA hooks for active views; ensure new announcements respect the existing tab semantics. [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#tabnavigation]
- Filter controls rely on labeled fieldsets and `aria-describedby` for counts; keep updates within those established patterns. [Source: architecture/key-implementations.md#speciesfilter---checkboxes-with-live-counts]

### File Locations

- Accessibility helpers live under `src/components/a11y/` including `LiveRegion.tsx` and skip links. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#project-organization]
- Layout scaffolding sits in `src/components/layout/MainLayout.tsx`; tab navigation is in the same directory. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#project-organization]
- Filter UI components (`FilterPanel`, species/island controls) are under `src/components/filters/`. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#project-organization]
- Visualization shells and chart components are located in `src/components/visualizations/` and its `charts/` folder. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#project-organization]

### Testing Requirements

- Follow the testing pyramid: Vitest + React Testing Library for component behavior, Cypress component + E2E for interaction flows, and axe-core for WCAG coverage. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-strategy]
- Accessibility tooling (axe, focus utilities) is part of the standard stack; integrate those checks into new tests. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#accessibility-stack]

### Technical Constraints

- Filter updates dispatch through the shared data flow that already triggers live region updates; hook new summaries into that pipeline to stay debounced with URL sync. [Source: architecture/data-flow.md#2-filter-state-synchronization]
- Loading states are tracked in the data store (`loadingState`), so announcements should mirror those transitions rather than introducing new booleans. [Source: architecture/state-management.md#data-store-datastorets]
- Maintain a single polite live region to prevent screen reader chatter; avoid `assertive` announcements unless explicitly required. [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#liveregion]

## Project Structure Notes

- Existing layout already defines header, navigation, and `main` landmarks—ensure any updates stay within the established structure instead of adding duplicate regions. [Source: architecture/routing.md#mainlayout---root-layout-component]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Extend live region coverage** (AC: 1, 5)
  - [ ] Update `LiveRegion` to consume both filter summaries and data store loading transitions so announcements stay centralized. [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#liveregion]
  - [ ] Tap into the filter synchronization flow so messages describe active filters and result counts after debounced updates. [Source: architecture/data-flow.md#2-filter-state-synchronization]
  - [ ] Surface loading/ready cues by subscribing to `loadingState` within the data store selector. [Source: architecture/state-management.md#data-store-datastorets]

- [ ] **Task 2: Provide dynamic chart descriptions** (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Enhance `VisualizationPanel`/`ChartContainer` to accept descriptive text derived from filtered data. [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#visualizationpanel]
  - [ ] Ensure tab routes pass summaries through existing props so descriptions follow the active chart. [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#tabnavigation]
  - [ ] Add assertions verifying the chart description updates when filters or chart types change. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-strategy]

- [ ] **Task 3: Audit form labeling and landmarks** (AC: 3, 4)
  - [ ] Confirm filter controls retain proper labels and helper text connections (`aria-label`, `aria-describedby`). [Source: architecture/key-implementations.md#filterpanel---responsive-collapsible-panel]
  - [ ] Validate the layout keeps header/nav/main landmarks and expose tests for skip link focus order. [Source: architecture/routing.md#mainlayout---root-layout-component]
  - [ ] Document any additional landmark or region tweaks inside layout components. [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#mainlayout]

- [ ] **Task 4: Validation and testing** (AC: 1-5)
  - [ ] Add Vitest + RTL coverage for live region text, loading announcements, and ARIA attributes. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-strategy]
  - [ ] Extend axe-core assertions (vitest-axe) to ensure no new violations after announcements fire. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#accessibility-stack]
  - [ ] Update Cypress accessibility suite to verify announcements occur during filter interactions and route changes. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-strategy]
