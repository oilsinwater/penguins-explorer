## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests
- **TECH-001**: Integration tests for URL-state synchronization (2.1-INT-005, 2.1-E2E-003)
- **PERF-001**: Performance tests with full 344-record dataset (2.1-UNIT-005 with large data)
- Required test types: Load testing, integration testing
- Test data requirements: Full penguin dataset with mixed species distribution

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests
- **ACCESS-001**: E2E accessibility testing with keyboard navigation (2.1-E2E-004)
- Edge case coverage: Invalid URL parameters, rapid checkbox toggling
- Standard functional tests for low risks

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- Unit tests for individual components
- Regression test suite for filter persistence

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### TECH-001: State Desynchronization
**Strategy**: Preventive  
**Actions**:
- Implement debounced state updates to prevent race conditions
- Add URL validation middleware
- Use Zustand middleware for state change logging  
**Testing Requirements**:
- Integration tests for bi-directional sync
- E2E tests for page refresh persistence  
**Residual Risk**: Low - Edge cases with network interruptions may still occur  
**Owner**: Dev  
**Timeline**: Before integration complete

### PERF-001: UI Blocking on Large Datasets
**Strategy**: Preventive  
**Actions**:
- Implement virtual scrolling in DataTable for large filtered results
- Add loading states during filter operations
- Use React.memo for filter components  
**Testing Requirements**:
- Performance testing with 344 records
- Memory leak detection during rapid filtering  
**Residual Risk**: Medium - Very large datasets may still cause delays  
**Owner**: Dev  
**Timeline**: During component implementation

### SEC-001: URL Parameter Exposure
**Strategy**: Detective  
**Actions**:
- Add privacy policy disclosure for filter persistence
- Implement optional filter persistence toggle  
**Testing Requirements**:
- Security review of URL parameters
- Privacy compliance validation  
**Residual Risk**: Low - No sensitive data involved  
**Owner**: QA  
**Timeline**: Before deployment

### ACCESS-001: Keyboard Navigation Failures
**Strategy**: Preventive  
**Actions**:
- Follow WCAG 2.1 checkbox group guidelines
- Add comprehensive keyboard event handlers
- Test with multiple screen readers (VoiceOver, NVDA)  
**Testing Requirements**:
- E2E accessibility testing (2.1-E2E-004)
- Manual keyboard navigation validation  
**Residual Risk**: Low - Standard accessibility practices mitigate most issues  
**Owner**: Dev  
**Timeline**: During UI implementation

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- TECH-001: State synchronization must pass all integration tests
- PERF-001: Filtering 344 records must complete under 500ms
- ACCESS-001: Keyboard navigation must achieve 100% WCAG compliance

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- SEC-001: Document privacy implications in user documentation
- DATA-001: Add data validation assertions in development

### Accepted Risks
- BUS-001: Accepted as inherent to feature design - users may choose not to use filtering
- OPS-001: Accepted with commitment to add tests post-MVP

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- Filter operation performance metrics (PERF-001)
- State synchronization error rates (TECH-001)
- Accessibility compliance scores (ACCESS-001)
- User engagement with filter feature (BUS-001)

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- New visualization components added (affects PERF-001)
- URL routing changes implemented (affects TECH-001)
- Accessibility requirements updated (affects ACCESS-001)
- Dataset size increases significantly (affects PERF-001)

## Risk Scoring Algorithm

Base Score = 100  
Deductions:  
- 2 High risks (6): -20 points  
- 1 Medium risk (4): -5 points  
- 4 Low risks (2-3): -8 points  
**Final Score: 78/100**

## Risk-Based Recommendations

### 1. Testing Priority
- Run TECH-001 and PERF-001 tests first in CI/CD pipeline
- Add performance budget enforcement for filtering operations
- Include accessibility audits in PR reviews

### 2. Development Focus
- Code review emphasis on state synchronization patterns
- Performance profiling during filter implementation
- Accessibility validation at component level

### 3. Deployment Strategy
- Feature flag for new filtering capability
- Canary deployment to monitor performance impact
- Rollback procedures for state synchronization issues

### 4. Monitoring Setup
- Track filter operation latency in application performance monitoring
- Monitor state synchronization errors in error tracking
- User behavior analytics for filter usage patterns

## Integration with Quality Gates

**Gate Decision**: CONCERNS  
**Rationale**: Two high-risk items (TECH-001, PERF-001) require mitigation before production. No critical risks blocking deployment.
