# Story 2.3: Filter by Sex

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** to filter by sex,  
**so that** I can focus on male, female, or all penguins in the dataset.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Radio buttons: All, Male, Female
2. Handles missing sex values appropriately
3. Mutually exclusive selection

## Tasks / Subtasks

    - [x] **Task 1: Implement Sex Filter Component** (AC: 1, 3)

- [x] Create `src/components/filters/SexFilter.tsx`
- [x] Implement MUI Radio Group with sex options (All, Male, Female)
- [x] Set "All" as default selection
- [x] Ensure mutually exclusive selection behavior

- [x] **Task 2: Connect Filter to State Management** (AC: 1, 3)

  - [x] Update Context API in `src/context/actions.ts` for sex filter state
  - [x] Add UPDATE_SEX_FILTER action type and creator
  - [x] Integrate with existing filter state from SpeciesFilter and IslandFilter
  - [x] Add URL persistence using TanStack Router for sex parameter

- [x] **Task 3: Apply Filtering Logic** (AC: 2, 3)

  - [x] Extend `src/utils/filtering.ts` to include sex filtering
  - [x] Handle missing sex values ("All" option shows all penguins including those with null/undefined sex)
  - [x] Ensure real-time updates to table and visualizations
  - [x] Update combined filtering logic to include sex filter

- [x] **Task 4: UI Integration** (AC: 1)

  - [x] Add SexFilter to existing filter layout in `src/pages/penguins/index.tsx`
  - [x] Ensure proper spacing and visual consistency with other filters
  - [x] Apply MUI theme styling consistent with SpeciesFilter and IslandFilter

- [x] **Task 5: Testing Implementation** (AC: All)
  - [x] Write Vitest unit tests for radio group interactions in `tests/unit/components/filters/SexFilter.test.tsx`
  - [x] Write Cypress integration tests for filter synchronization in `tests/integration/filters/SexFilter.cy.tsx`
  - [x] Test URL state persistence and instant filtering in E2E tests
  - [x] Validate accessibility with axe-core for radio group patterns and ARIA labels
  - [x] Test missing sex value handling scenarios
  - [x] Fix unit test syntax error and verify Cypress after dev server

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**Source: [docs/stories/2.2.filter-by-island.story.md#completion-notes]**

- Use Context API for global filter state management (established pattern)
- URL state persistence via TanStack Router works for multi-filter scenarios
- Filtering logic in `src/utils/filtering.ts` handles real-time updates efficiently
- Vitest and Cypress testing patterns established for filters
- MUI theme integration and accessibility patterns established
- Combined filtering logic supports multiple filter types working together

### UI Component Specifications

**Source: [docs/architecture/component-architecture.md#filter-components]**

- Use MUI v5 FormControl and RadioGroup components (@mui/material) for radio buttons
- Radio group pattern with proper fieldset structure
- Emotion CSS-in-JS for styling
- MUI theme system for consistent design tokens
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with radio group navigation and ARIA labels

### State Management Requirements

**Source: [docs/architecture/state-management.md#filter-store]**

- Context API for global app state including filters (NOT Zustand as originally documented)
- Current implementation uses: selectedSpecies (array), selectedIsland (string), need to add selectedSex (string)
- Memoized selectors for performance in `src/context/selectors.ts` (if exists)
- Integrate with existing filter state without conflicts
- Default value: "all" to show all penguins including those with missing sex values

### Routing Integration

**Source: [docs/architecture/routing.md] + Previous Story Insights**

- TanStack Router for URL state: Add `sex` parameter (e.g., ?sex=male)
- Bidirectional sync: URL changes update state, state changes update URL
- Follow same pattern as island filter implementation

### File Structure Requirements

**Source: [docs/architecture/source-tree.md]**

```
src/
└── components/
    └── filters/
        └── SexFilter.tsx  # MUI RadioGroup with sex options and styling
```

Update `src/pages/penguins/index.tsx` to include SexFilter alongside SpeciesFilter and IslandFilter

### Data Handling Specifications

**Source: [docs/prd.md#us2.3] + Data Insights**

- Sex values in dataset: "male", "female", or null/undefined for missing values
- "All" option must include penguins with missing sex values
- Radio group ensures mutually exclusive selection (only one option can be selected)
- Handle edge case where sex data is missing or malformed

### Testing Requirements

**Source: [docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md] + Previous Story Patterns**

- **Unit Tests**: Vitest + React Testing Library in `tests/unit/components/filters/SexFilter.test.tsx`
- **Integration Tests**: Cypress in `tests/integration/filters/SexFilter.cy.tsx`
- **E2E Tests**: Cypress in `tests/e2e/user-flows/filtering.cy.ts`
- Coverage: Radio group selection, URL sync, data updates, accessibility, missing value handling
- Test Data: Penguins with various sex values including missing data
- Follow established testing patterns from SpeciesFilter and IslandFilter tests

### Accessibility Requirements

**Source: [docs/architecture/component-architecture.md#sexfilter]**

- WCAG 2.1 AA: Radio group pattern with proper fieldset/legend structure
- ARIA labels for screen reader announcements on selection change
- Keyboard navigation (arrow keys for radio group navigation)
- Focus management for radio group
- Clear labels and descriptions for each option

### Performance Considerations

**Source: [Previous Story Insights]**

- Memoization for filter computations (established in existing filtering logic)
- Real-time updates using existing memoized filtering approach
- No debouncing needed for radio selection (immediate selection)

**Quality Assessment Summary:**

Story 2.3 demonstrates excellent technical foundation with comprehensive risk assessment and robust test design. Pre-implementation analysis identified 4 total risks (1 medium data handling, 3 low technical/business/performance) with manageable impact through established patterns from previous filter implementations.

**Key Findings:**

- Perfect alignment with established Context API and MUI component patterns from Stories 2.1 & 2.2
- Comprehensive test strategy with 14 scenarios across unit/integration/E2E levels
- Proper handling of edge cases including missing sex values through "All" option
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance addressed via radio group patterns and axe-core testing

**Risk Profile:**

- Risk Score: 92/100 (Low - Minor data handling considerations)
- Primary Concern: Missing sex value handling (mitigated via comprehensive test design)

**Test Design:**

- 100% AC coverage with appropriate test level distribution
- 8 P0 critical tests for core functionality
- Edge case coverage for null/undefined sex values
- Accessibility testing for screen reader and keyboard navigation

**Readiness Assessment:**
Story provides complete technical context with proven implementation patterns. Risk mitigation through established filtering logic and comprehensive test coverage ensures low implementation risk.
