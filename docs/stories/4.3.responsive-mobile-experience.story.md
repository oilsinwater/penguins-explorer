# Story 4.3: Responsive Mobile Experience

## Status

To Do

## Story

**As a** mobile user,
**I want** a responsive experience,
**so that** I can use the penguin explorer on my mobile device.

_Part of Epic 4: Accessibility & Usability (docs/prd/user-stories-acceptance-criteria.md)._

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Single column layout below 768px.
2. Touch-friendly tap targets (44x44px min).
3. Card-based layout for table data.
4. Collapsible filter panel.
5. Charts resize appropriately.

### Component Specifications

- Layout components should adapt to mobile breakpoints. [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md]
- Filter panel should support collapsible behavior. [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#filterpanel]
- Charts should be responsive to container size. [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#visualizationpanel]

- Filter components: `src/components/filters/` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Visualization components: `src/components/visualizations/` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

### Testing Requirements

- Use Cypress for responsive design testing. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test across multiple device sizes. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

### Technical Constraints

- Maintain existing desktop functionality while adding mobile support. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Use MUI's responsive utilities where possible. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
