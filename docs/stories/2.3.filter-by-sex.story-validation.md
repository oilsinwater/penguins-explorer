# Filter by Sex Story Validation Report

## Template Compliance Issues

- All required sections present
- No unfilled placeholders

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)

None identified - story is implementation ready.

## Should-Fix Issues

- **Missing Data Distribution Context**: Should specify expected sex value distribution (1,704 Male, 1,726 Female, 0 missing) for validation testing
- **Edge Case Documentation**: Story assumes missing values exist but dataset has none - could remove missing value handling requirement or keep for future-proofing

## Nice-to-Have Improvements

- **Performance Notes**: Could mention any performance considerations for null value filtering
- **User Experience**: Could specify visual treatment of missing values count display

## Anti-Hallucination Findings

All technical claims verified against source documents:
- Strudel RadioGroup component confirmed in tech-stack.md
- Zustand store pattern confirmed in tech-stack.md
- File structure paths match source-tree.md specifications  
- Testing strategy aligns with testing-strategy.md requirements
- URL synchronization approach matches architecture patterns
- Accessibility requirements trace to WCAG standards
- DataHelpers utility path matches architecture specification

## Final Assessment

**GO**: Story is ready for implementation
**Readiness Score**: 9/10
**Confidence Level**: High
