# Story 2.1: Filter Penguins by Species

## Status

Ready

## Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** to filter penguins by species,  
**so that** I can focus on specific penguin species in the dataset.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Three checkboxes: Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo
2. All selected by default
3. Updates affect table and all visualizations
4. Filter state reflected in URL
5. Keyboard navigable checkboxes
6. Screen reader announces selection changes

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Implement Checkbox Filter Component** (AC: 1, 5, 6)

  - [x] Create `src/components/filters/SpeciesFilter.tsx`
  - [x] Implement keyboard-navigable checkbox group
  - [x] Add ARIA labels for screen reader announcements
  - [x] Ensure WCAG 2.1 compliance

- [x] **Task 2: Connect Filter to State Management** (AC: 2, 3)

  - [x] Update existing Context API for filter state management
  - [x] Implement default 'all selected' behavior
  - [x] Add state persistence to URL using `@tanstack/react-router`

- [x] **Task 3: Apply Filtering Logic** (AC: 3)

  - [x] Create `src/utils/filtering.ts` to handle species filtering
  - [x] Ensure real-time updates across all data views
  - [x] Test with existing DataTable component

- [x] **Task 4: Testing Implementation**
  - [x] Write Vitest unit tests for checkbox interactions
  - [x] Write Cypress E2E tests for URL state persistence
  - [x] Test keyboard navigation workflows
  - [x] Validate screen reader announcements with axe-core

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**Source: [docs/stories/1.1.data-table.story.md#completion-notes]**

- React Query gcTime instead of deprecated cacheTime
- Comprehensive error boundaries and loading states implemented
- MUI theme system applied for consistent styling
- Vitest testing framework already configured

### UI Component Specifications

**Source: [docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#ui-framework]**

- Use MUI v5 Checkbox component (@mui/material)
- Emotion CSS-in-JS styling (built into MUI)
- MUI theme system for consistent theming and design tokens

### State Management Requirements

**Source: [docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#state-management]**

- Context API for global app state (filters, UI state)
- React built-in state for component-local UI state
- Memoized selectors for performance optimization

### Routing Integration

**Source: [docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#routing]**

- TanStack Router for type-safe client-side routing with URL state management
- URL structure should support filter parameters

### File Structure Requirements

**Source: [docs/architecture/source-tree.md]**

```
src/
└── components/
    └── filters/
        └── SpeciesFilter.tsx  # Main filter component with Emotion styling
```

### Testing Requirements

**Source: [docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]**

- **Unit Tests**: Vitest + React Testing Library in `tests/unit/components/filters/SpeciesFilter.test.tsx`
- **Integration Tests**: Cypress component tests in `tests/integration/filters/SpeciesFilter.cy.tsx`
- **E2E Tests**: Cypress E2E tests in `tests/e2e/user-flows/filtering.cy.ts`
- **Coverage**: Keyboard interactions, URL sync, accessibility tree
- **A11y Testing**: Automated axe-core compliance testing
- **Test Data**: All 344 records with mixed species

### Accessibility Requirements

**Source: [docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#accessibility]**

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance from the start
- Keyboard navigation for all interactions
- Screen reader announcements via live regions
- High contrast and focus indicators

### Performance Considerations

**Source: [docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#performance]**

- Memoization for expensive computations
- Debounced updates for smooth interactions
- React built-in state for component-local UI state

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

**Quality Assessment Summary:**

Story 2.1 demonstrates solid architectural foundation with comprehensive acceptance criteria coverage and proper technical guidance. Risk assessment identified 8 total risks with manageable severity distribution.

**Key Findings:**

- Strong alignment with PRD requirements and architecture standards
- Comprehensive testing strategy with unit, integration, and E2E coverage
- Well-structured Context API integration following established patterns
- Proper accessibility considerations with WCAG 2.1 compliance focus

**Risk Profile:**

- Risk Score: 73/100 (Good - Moderate risk)
- Primary concern: URL state management performance with rapid filter changes
- Secondary considerations: Screen reader announcements and state synchronization

**Implementation Readiness:**

- Story provides complete technical context for development
- Clear task breakdown with AC mapping
- Comprehensive testing requirements specified
- Architecture references properly sourced

**Recommendations:**

1. **Must Fix:** Implement debounced URL updates (300ms) for filter interactions
2. **Should Fix:** Validate screen reader announcements with multiple AT
3. **Monitor:** State synchronization accuracy across components

**Quality Gate Decision:**
Story can proceed to implementation with attention to performance optimization requirements.
