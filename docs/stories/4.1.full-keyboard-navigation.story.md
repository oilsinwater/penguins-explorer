# Story 4.1: Full Keyboard Navigation

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** keyboard user,
**I want** full keyboard navigation throughout the application,
**so that** I can efficiently navigate and interact with all features without using a mouse.

_Part of Epic 4: Accessibility & Usability from PRD (docs/prd/user-stories-acceptance-criteria.md)._

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Tab order follows logical flow throughout the application
2. All interactive elements are reachable and operable with keyboard
3. Visual focus indicators meet WCAG standards for visibility
4. Skip to main content link is available and functional
5. Keyboard shortcuts implemented: / focuses search, ? opens help, Esc closes modals
6. Escape key consistently closes modals and dropdowns

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Previous stories have established accessibility patterns in the ScatterPlot component with keyboard navigation for data points using arrow keys and focus management. The architecture already includes dedicated a11y components and ARIA patterns.

### Component Structure Requirements

[Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#accessibility-components]

- **`SkipLinks.tsx`**: Hidden links that appear on focus for keyboard navigation shortcuts (skip to main content, filters, and data)
- **`FocusTrap.tsx`**: Modal focus management component for trapping focus within modal dialogs
- **Existing components need enhancement**: MainLayout, FilterPanel, DataTable, ChartTypeSelector, modals

### File Locations

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#accessibility-components]

- `src/components/a11y/SkipLinks.tsx` - Skip link implementation
- `src/components/a11y/FocusTrap.tsx` - Focus trap for modals
- `src/hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts.ts` - Global keyboard shortcut handling
- Update existing layout and interaction components for proper tab order

### UI Component Specifications

[Source: architecture/component-architecture.md, architecture/key-implementations.md]

- **Focus indicators**: Use MUI theme's focus styles with WCAG AA compliant contrast ratios
- **Tab order**: Logical flow through MainLayout → Skip links → FilterPanel → TabNavigation → Main content
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Global event handlers for / (search focus), ? (help modal), Esc (close)
- **Interactive elements**: All buttons, links, form controls, chart elements must be focusable

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- **Unit Tests (Vitest + RTL)**: Keyboard event handling, focus management, tab order
- **Integration Tests (Cypress Component)**: Component keyboard interactions, modal focus traps
- **E2E Tests (Cypress)**: Full keyboard navigation flows, skip link functionality
- **Accessibility Tests (axe-core)**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, zero critical violations for keyboard navigation

### Technical Constraints

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, architecture/coding-standards.md]

- Use MUI's built-in focus management utilities
- Follow ARIA patterns consistently across all components
- Maintain TypeScript strict mode compliance for all accessibility code
- Use established coding standards with proper component structure

### Test Data Requirements

[Addresses QA Finding TEST-001]

- **Keyboard Navigation Test Data**: Use existing penguins.json dataset (344 records) with specific filtering scenarios:
  - Empty filter results for testing "no data" keyboard navigation
  - Full dataset for testing pagination keyboard navigation
  - Species filter combinations (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo) for multi-select keyboard testing
- **Screen Reader Test Scenarios**:
  - Chart data with mixed data types for ARIA label generation
  - Filter state announcements with various active filter combinations
  - Modal content with structured heading hierarchy

### Keyboard Shortcut Conflict Prevention

[Addresses QA Finding ARCH-001]

- **Browser Conflict Strategy**:
  - `/` key: Only activate when no form inputs are focused to avoid conflicts with search
  - `?` key: Use Shift+/ combination, check for existing help shortcuts in browser
  - `Esc` key: Standard behavior, safe to implement for modal/dropdown closing
- **Implementation**: Add event.preventDefault() and event.stopPropagation() for captured shortcuts
- **Documentation**: Include keyboard shortcut help in HelpModal with conflict notes

### Testing

**Test File Locations**: `tests/unit/components/a11y/`, `tests/integration/accessibility/`, `cypress/e2e/accessibility/`

**Testing Requirements**:

- 85% line coverage for accessibility components
- Zero critical axe violations
- Manual keyboard navigation testing across all user flows
- Screen reader compatibility testing

**Testing Frameworks**: Vitest + React Testing Library for units, Cypress for integration/E2E, axe-core for accessibility validation
