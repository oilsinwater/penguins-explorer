# Scatter Plots Story Validation Report

## Template Compliance Issues

- All required sections present  
- No unfilled placeholders

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)

- **Missing Strudel Chart Components**: Dev Notes reference "Strudel Chart components (scatter plot variant)" but tech-stack.md only mentions D3.js utilities and custom React components - needs architecture verification

## Should-Fix Issues

- **Numeric Column Specification**: Task mentions specific columns (bill_length, bill_depth, flipper_length, body_mass) but should reference dynamic discovery from dataset
- **Missing Performance Context**: Chart rendering with 3,430 data points needs performance considerations beyond 300ms debounce

## Nice-to-Have Improvements

- **Data Sampling Strategy**: Could specify approach for large dataset rendering optimization
- **Chart Interaction States**: Could define loading/error states for chart rendering

## Anti-Hallucination Findings

**⚠️ ARCHITECTURE INCONSISTENCY DETECTED:**
- Story claims "Strudel Chart components (scatter plot variant)" but tech-stack.md specifies "Custom React chart components wrapping D3 functionality"
- File structure in Dev Notes doesn't match architecture/source-tree.md chart component organization
- Need to verify if Strudel includes chart components or if custom D3 implementation required

## Final Assessment

**NO-GO**: Story requires architecture clarification before implementation  
**Readiness Score**: 6/10  
**Confidence Level**: Medium

### Blocking Issues
- Unclear chart component library (Strudel vs custom D3)
- File structure inconsistency with architecture docs  
- Missing performance strategy for 3,430+ data points

### Once Resolved
- Good acceptance criteria coverage
- Comprehensive accessibility planning
- Strong integration with filter system
