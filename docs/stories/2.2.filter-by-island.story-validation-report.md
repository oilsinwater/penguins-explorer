# Filter by Island Story Validation Report

## Template Compliance Issues

- All required sections present
- No unfilled placeholders

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)

None identified - story is implementation ready.

## Should-Fix Issues

- **Testing Integration Dependencies**: Story references dependency on Story 2.1 filtering infrastructure completion - should explicitly define what "filtering infrastructure" components are required
- **Missing Test Data Requirements**: Tasks mention testing but don't specify required test penguin data - should reference expected island distribution counts for validation

## Nice-to-Have Improvements

- **Performance Considerations**: Could mention debounce implementation details in Dev Notes
- **Error State Handling**: Could define behavior when island data is unavailable

## Anti-Hallucination Findings

All technical claims verified against source documents:
- Strudel Select component confirmed in tech-stack.md
- Zustand store pattern confirmed in tech-stack.md  
- File structure paths match source-tree.md specifications
- Testing strategy aligns with testing-strategy.md requirements
- URL synchronization approach matches architecture patterns
- Accessibility requirements trace to WCAG 2.1 AA standards

## Final Assessment

**GO**: Story is ready for implementation
**Readiness Score**: 8/10
**Confidence Level**: High

### Implementation Notes
- Complete acceptance criteria coverage by tasks
- Comprehensive Dev Notes with architecture alignment
- Clear component specifications and file structure
- Proper testing approach with specific test scenarios
- Good task granularity and logical sequencing
