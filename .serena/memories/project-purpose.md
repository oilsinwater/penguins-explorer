# Project Purpose\n\nThe Palmer Penguins Explorer is a demo application built with the Strudel Kit, a React and TypeScript starter kit for scientific UIs. It allows users to explore the Palmer Penguins dataset (344 records) through data tables, filtering, and visualizations like scatter plots, histograms, and box plots. The goal is to showcase Strudel Kit's capabilities for building accessible scientific data exploration tools.
